Books_5,5.0,OR,I read this book years ago and I still find myself talking about it and recommending to friends. It is a wonderful story and reminds us that not everyone sat by and did nothing during the holacaust. Many people risked their lives to do the right thing. I recommend this book highly.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have high arches and because of this, initially found that the part of the shoe that goes over the top of my foot close to my ankle is so rigid that they were uncomfortable to wear for more than a little while at a time. Fortunately, since they are leather, the break-in was very brief and they are now extremely comfortable. Additionally, they are great looking and seem to be very high quality--I am confident that they will last.  Also, I think the footbed is very comfortable and they seem to support my high arches just fine. I have both the patent black leather and the blue Cayman style. The blue Cayman is absolutely Exquisite and the color in the picture does not do the shoe Justice. It is a beautiful almost metallic silvery blue and I just love it.

Also be sure you understand the difference between the professional clog and the pro XP mule. I find the pro XP mule to be significantly more comfortable than the regular professional clog and worth the extra money."

I received this booties in a very timely manner and I highly recommend it to anyone who may have a size 10 or 11 in these booties. I'm going to order a half size larger in the Invicta Men's 1278 II and am happy with them.

I would not recommend these booties for anyone who does not have a size 10 or 11. They run a bit big for me, but if you are a size 10 or 11, you will probably"

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I loved this device when I first received it. It is slim, lightweight, had a good feel to the keys and was a USB device. However, after about a month of using it a few of the keys started to kind of stick. Next thing I knew, it was causing my computer to go crazy. I wasn't able to type using it was flashing text. As soon as I disconnected the device my computer worked perfectly again. I can only assume one of the keys was permanently stuck (although I can't figure out which one) and so it was trying to type that character over and over. I am just out of the return window and so I am stuck with it. Luckily it wasn't more expensive than it is. I believe I saw a few comments here about people with similar experiences. Please believe them as I think this is likely to happen to you too. Oh yeah, I am a very light computer user. This was only used for personal business not a work computer."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"It leaks, it leaks!

Dang.

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one. Removing the old cylinder just took one good whack, then installing this one was easy, everything fit nicely.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Oh well.

I will try again with a different manufacturer. I will modify this review if it turns out that it's somehow the chair's fault, rather than the piston's fault."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I use lens hoods to improve contrast, as well as to provide a bit of physical protection for the lens, since I don't believe in adding a ""protective"" filter to the front of a lens, except where there is a chemical or severe debris risk. That said, this one is pretty small, so not much protection physically, but if it helps increase contrast, then it will be worth the investment."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A River Bend Wedding celebrates the planning and pre-wedding events for the couple that started us all on the journey in River Bend, NE, Josh and Carissa.

Five and half years are what it has taken for Josh and Carissa to get to this point.  Their joys and trials, tears and cheers, kicks and kisses; we went through them all with this couple. Now we get to see all that love for each other, as well as from their friends and family, celebrated in A River Bend Wedding.

This is a Novella and is best read after reading books 1-4 in the series. Everything comes to a happily ever after and leaves nothing hanging in this story, but don't fret, there are more to come in River Bend.

Molly McLain once again has captured my heart with this endearing group of characters and transported me back to their little town that I fell in love with in Cant Shake You."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.  Henry's book was worth the wait.  I loved that the conflict facing the couple was not external to them but internal fears that the Diana most conquer before getting her happily ever after.  After reading so many books that have gentlemen spies or villains it was nice to read a book that focused on the characters and their relationship.  I loved this book and hope that more Weston books will be coming.

I love a good mystery with a great twist.  I love the way the story unfolds and the twists and turns that happen with each new twist.  The story was all about the very beginning of the book.  I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job of pulling the reader in and showing us the world we live in.  The characters are all very well developed and believable.

I did not have the problem of having to remove the charger from the charger when I had to use it. I am very pleased with this product.I love this camera!  I love it because the flash is so small, and I don't need to worry about it breaking after a long day or so.  I love the way it fits my camera, and I love that it's small, too.  It also has the zoom feature that I had a few years ago, so I have to keep it on my camera while I shoot in the field.  I really like the fact that the camera will automatically turn off when the lens is fully charged.  It's a great little camera, but I'm a big fan of the Nikon DX-SLR.  I was very excited when I saw that the camera would have a menu on it for setting it up, but the menu was not very clear.  I also got the auto-focus feature.  It's a nice feature, but I found that it was too obvious to use.  It does not appear to be a feature that is useful to me, but I would certainly like to see it in the future.  I was very pleased with the photos I got. "
Books_5,5.0,OR,".......during this peculiar political season - make it this one.

The whole thing - every page - from beginning to end is sardonic and ingeniusly written.  The humor is not restricted to just one format.  There are hilarious forms to fill out, games to play and paragraphs that made me flat-out laugh and giggle.

The phrasing and timing of each ""piece"" is perfect and if you can imagine some of these spoofs on the show it's even more hysterical.  But you never need to have seen the show to enjoy this book and I mean just enjoy it - page after hilarious page."

One minute he was thinking about killing here and the next she's getting oral sex on the beach. It moved to fast. The whole Aristotle part in the book was od creepy. Didn't understand it. Neither the gypsies part. I would say it gave the book another dimension to it. It was not just about gangs and stuff. Was it needed? To me no. The book started off great and it was funny and kept the reader entertained. But towards the middle it started to get weird. I'm like it's it a dark book or a paranormal book.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I bought this set to mainly use for my lunches.  I prepare my lunches for the week ahead of time and these are perfect for that.  I can also use them for additional food storage in the fridge or pantry if I need to. I have bought many different sets of plastic containers recently trying to find ones that would work for me and also be easy to open and close.  These seem to do the trick and so far I am very happy with them.  Love the orange color too!

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is an ""no brainer"" as it gets for an accessory for the Olympus OMD-E-M5 camera. It not only brings an entirely new ergonomics to the camera (for the better) but adds several more controls enhancing it's professional use to say the least. But build is like Fort Knox perfection. NO gaps and it's solid as a rock once installed. I prefer to use the battery access on the grip altogether than bother with removal to install in the main body. The grip is a HUGE enhancement and you always feel like it's locked in your hands allowing for lower shutter speed shooting as well. If you have a OMD ""Just Get It"" and don't look back"

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Adam Schonberg is in medical school and trying to make ends meet without the support of either his or his wife, Jennifer's, parents.  His family was not happy when he married outside the Jewish religion.  Now he finds that their already struggling family of two is about to be a family of three and he doesn't know how to cope or manage financially.  Jennifer will have to quit her job as a dancer and so Adam decides to take a leave of absence from medical school to go work for a drug company.  But all is not what it seems with their fancy corporate headquarters and high dollar paychecks.  Adam soon finds himself in the middle of a corporate plan to take over the field of medicine by drugging and mind controlling as many doctors as the company can get their hands on.  All the while, Adam must deal with the conflict developing between Jennifer and himself because of his suspicions that her OBGYN is drugged as well.

Cook weaves an extremely interesting conspiracy theory about how the business world is beginning to affect medicine and it's treatment, or lack thereof, of patients.  It confronts the  idea that for-profit companies will continue to have an influence on the field of medicine that is not always as positive as these companies would lead you to believe.  The unfortunate aspect of this book was that the story line jumped from idea to idea a bit and often portrays Jennifer in a overly simplistic and patronizing manner.  Just when the adventure really heats up, the story ends abruptly and rather predictably.  A story with a lot of potential ended flat and in disappointment.  Still, one still finishes with the contemplation that Cook intended."

I felt like I was in the story.  It's very realistic.  I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt, but I'm not sure why.  I'm sure it was because the book is so different from other books in the series.  I think it's because I have read the other books.  It's a different story than I've read all of the other books.  It's very different from the other books.  I think it's because I'm not a big fan of the book.  I like the book.  It's very realistic and there is a lot of action in it.  I love the book.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Somebody to Love is the third book in the Cupid, Texas series by Lorie Wilde.  Jericho Chance is a sexy cowboy turn scholar.  He knows what he wants from life and how he is going to get it.  The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.

Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.  I will be picking up the other books in the series shortly."

There is a strong female character that seems to be a bit of a submissive, but there are a lot of male characters that are just not in the same boat as the rest of the characters.  The main female character is a bit more fleshed out, but I felt like I was missing something.  I just didn't feel like I was there for the story.  It's very frustrating to have to go back and re-read the book, but I'm not sure I will be rereading this one.  It's definitely a book that you should read.This was a very good book.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Denons ear-bud headphones are simple, comfortable to wear, and offer high sound quality.

The Denons are understated, but stylish.  They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents.  The materials and the fit and finish are high.  Included with the headphones are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large.  Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for.  I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s.

The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inches down from the right ear-bud.  The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command.  Its very intuitive and simple to use.

Sound quality of the Denons is high.  I listened to all types of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice.  Bass was strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered.  Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound.  Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I was also able to hear subtle instruments and vocals that I would have missed otherwise.  The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times.

The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tips fit my average sized ears best.  The headphones fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit.  Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity levels they should work fine.  They are also light in weight.  The cord is long enough to not tug on the headphones when you move, but not so long that it gets in the way.

All in all you cant ask for much more from ear-buds."

The ""hook' mentioned in the description, is actually a loop of plastic. You would still need something like a hook to hang the boots off of a rod or another hook. The insert is also pretty slick and easily slides out of my boots, when I hold them by the loop.... so hanging from this loop may not be possible, to begin with. (Maybe I'm doing something wrong?)

The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would hold a lot more.  I also love the fact that it is the most convenient mug I have ever had.  It has a very nice mug holder, so I don't have to worry about it getting burned when I go to wash it.  I do wish the color was a little brighter, but it's not bad.  It's just that the mug is a bit smaller than it appears.  It would be nice"

It kept me interested throughout and I had to read it several times to get the full story.  I'm happy to say that this book is on my favorites list.I really enjoyed this book and it was good. I liked that the author of the book did not seem to have any self-satisfaction. I liked the story line but I felt like it was very self-absorbed and was very self-centered. I also liked that the author did not seem to have any control over the main character. I liked that the author did not seem to have any interest in the main character's feelings.I enjoyed this book.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,This didn't work for my son's coffee pot so I should have ready a little deeper. He is in Germany and I sent this to him. It works fine for his phone and laptop but I had to order a heavier duty one for the coffee pot.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"Works great for us, not a big fan of the stovetop.  This is a great one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a big fan of it.  The color is beautiful and the quality is amazing.  I wish it was a bit thicker, but it works well.  I love the color, the size, the weight.  It has a very nice height for a coffee pot, and it is easy to hold and move.  I'm very happy with this purchase.These are great.  I love that they are made of glass.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"They came in tact.  The latches are fine.  The latches are the slide-y kind.  Yeah, they aren't the BEST, but for storage of crap, they work fine.  I wouldn't store Grandma's heirloom china in them, but for my stock-piling of bathroom stuff, they work fine."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,What a great read. I loved it and am looking forward to reading more from this author. I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. I love this book. The characters are well written and the story is a bit predictable. This is a great series for young adults. I have read the first book in the series and am looking forward to reading the next one.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,CG,"First of all, I did not have the time to try this out.  I would have given it a 5.5 stars but, considering that the box was advertised to be 4.5"" tall, it is not.  I was expecting it to be 4"" tall but, with the height of the bathroom, the width of the shower is right on the mark.  I will say that I had to use a different size shower curtain to fit it.  I am very pleased with this product.  I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.  I am very pleased with this shower curtain.  I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"Super comfortable! I love the material. The only problem is that it's a little too large for me. If you want a nice, solid, and light wallet, this is it! The wallet is well made and the outside is thin enough to hold everything I need to carry. The wallet is a bit smaller than I expected and it's very comfortable. It's a little heavier than I expected but I love it! I can't say enough good things about this wallet! I'm very happy with this wallet! I'm looking forward to wearing it everyday for the first time!

Overall, it's a great wallet. It's a nice looking wallet. It's a bit big but I like it and I'm happy to have it in my purse. It's also a good quality. I wish it had a little more space for my credit cards. I wish it had a small pocket too. I'm hoping this will last a long time.My daughter loves these shoes. She loves them. They fit well, they are very soft and comfortable. I wear them all the time. My son was very impressed with them. I ordered the white one and I wore it for all my daily activities. It is very comfortable and nice looking. The fit is perfect. The color is a nice gold tone. My son loves them and they are a perfect size to wear.I was very happy with my purchase.  My wife had never owned a pair of sunglasses before, but I needed a pair for her to wear with her to school.  The pair is comfortable and fits well."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This book was so very excellent. To see what Dream has been through and she is able to push through is amazing along with Camryn and Cammile.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased this in an attempt to help my wife (who has chronic neck pain) have more support in the car.  She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she forgot it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,Poorly made. Not leg is not snug enough to stay in place.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I should have ordered them a half size smaller. This happens to me a lot with shoes, so no big surprise. Otherwise, they look and feel great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Pretty but not functional. Fabric is too light and it doesn't stay in place whatsoever no matter how often you adjust it. Give it 3-stars due to the description being accurate and loving the color
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I bought a protective glove for when I use this because it is really sharp (and scary).  It worked great for slicing the fresh ginger to make candied ginger.  Love the different thickness adjustments.  Small size to store in small kitchen.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"This system is fine if you are close to it, like the computer or video games, but for entertainment center use, it's just not as great as I was hoping. Sure, certain DVD's are louder, but some I've tried just are not as loud as I'd want with this system. I'd be better off hooking it up to my old component stereo system to get the loudness I want. I admit, the subwoofer puts out good bass, but the main speakers just don't have enough loudness."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,Another great product from OXO.  The pot holder is light and comfortable to use.  It keeps heat away quite well.
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought for my mom and she loves them. True to the color. I'm going to order the orange for my living room.

My grandson had to wear a size 8 and it was way too long. I am very pleased with this purchase. My son is a size 8 and this is perfect!  He is 6 months old and it's a little snug.

He is a 36D and wears a medium. I love the color and the fit. It's a nice fit. He has wide feet and this fit him well. It's not thick material but it's thin enough to not make it difficult to wear.

I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in history.I loved this book.  It was very well written and I was so excited about it.  I was actually reading it in a moment.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Last night, just after midnight, my book came in and I started reading. I finished it this morning and I was not disappointed. The Fae are back and Mercy is in the center of the chaos. Where else does the not quite daughter of Coyote belong?
Events unfold and we learn some Fae are very good at their version of the long game. Mercy does what she does best, protecting those who need protection, creating a situation that puts the pack in danger and has Adam take action. I don't like giving away the joy so I will say little more about the plot. What I will say is this it is a fast read because you will want to keep going."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3. Since the Surface is pretty limited on USB slots, I thought it would be best to have a Bluetooth mouse so that I wouldn't have a dongle filling up my singular USB slot. I also wanted to have a small mouse that I could easily carry in my laptop bag. This mouse is great in terms of those two things. I was actually very happy with this mouse upon arrival. Connectivity was easy, the size was great, and the look of the mouse is nice too.

Now after 4 months of use I find that my left click is starting to stick. It's only happening about once or twice per day but I feel like it's a problem that's only going to get worse over time. I'm hoping I'm wrong but we shall see. If this started happening after even 1 year of daily use, I would feel like I had gotten my money's worth but to be happening after only 4 months is very disappointing."

The chemistry between the characters was well done and I found myself wishing they had been as close to each other as possible. I felt like I was rooting for them, but I also felt like I was rooting for them because I just didn't feel like they were there for each other.

In ""Never Deal with Dragons"", Myrna is a professional dragon mediator. As one of the few humans who can talk to the dragons who have taken over the world, Myrna is in charge of dealing with all of the crap that dragons bring to the human realm. However, is she up to the task of working with her ex-boyfriend on a high profile dragon mediation case that could change her career?

This book was fun and well written, which I didn't quite expect. It was surprisingly clever, super light, and an easy read. Did it keep my attention all the way through? Not 100%.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Business professional Dylan Johns needs to take a break, and he decides to do something unusual, something hes never done before. Michaela Western, is one of the very few women cruise directors around, and she intends to keep the respect she has earned the hard way. Until she sees Dylan, who makes her rethink a few things, but she has to be careful or she could be fired: on-board romances are frowned upon.

Ill put is simply: THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is excellent! Its so very well written; Ms. DeWintons prose is very expressive, flowing and so easy to read. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE really made me want to go on such a cruise: the author describes the ship and the setting  Australia and New Zealand  so well, I felt I was there. I also love how Ms. DeWinton portrays the dance environment and the performers; that was a lot of fun. Dylan and Michaela are both such fabulous characters. Michaela is very confident in her abilities, but she is almost all-business all the time; she cares almost too much about her job and she desperately tries to rein in her passionate nature. Dylan is seductive and charming, but not aggressive; still he decides Michaela will relax even if it kills him. The chemistry between Michaela and Dylan is sizzling and feels very real.

I love the playfulness and the interactions between Dylan and Michaela; Dylan is quite a wonderful hero and steps up when needed. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is a wonderful romance, sexy and yet very realistic as the romance progresses naturally. HE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is fresh, colourful, fun and very entertaining!"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book presents an overwhelming topic in a very non-overwhelming way.  Ten year-old Akilah finds her best friend changed when she comes back from a summer trip to Nigeria to visit her grandmother and go through a ""coming of age ceremony.""  Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.

Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten.

Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.

I highly recommend this book to girls age 12 and up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased the Hanes Men's Long Sleeve Crew with Microfleece Pant Pajama Set for my son.  For the price, the quality of this set is pretty amazing.  I bought a size large and both pieces fit perfectly.  My son is about 5'11"" and 170 pounds.  Recently, he's had a hard time finding pajama pants that are the right length. So when I found this set, I had to try it.  They're just perfect!  The plaid pajama bottoms that come with this set are extremely soft, comfortable, and warm.  They have an elastic band, as well as a drawstring, so they fit a variety of sizes.  I personally think that the long sleeve t-shirt is a stylish choice for the younger male that doesn't want to wear a matching button up pajama top in the same print and it's a heavier material than a regular t-shirt.

I'm going to pick up another pair, most likely in the other color that's available, because they're such a great deal at this price and the fit is true to size.  These are a great choice if you're looking for a little gift for any male in your life.  The soft, fuzzy bottoms would also be nice for a woman.  Just make sure you check the sizing!"

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

The author constructs a wonderful world to set her story in and develops strong, interesting characters over the three books. In the first book, A Great and Terrible Beauty, she outlines her initial plot about a girl raised in colonial India but forced to move to a boarding school in late 19th century England after her mother is murdered. The intrigue, romance, fantastical elements, and believable scenery of England during that era make it an engaging tale. It is a great story, but also very well written.

The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story.  That fiction is just that.

Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends.  She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home -  Northanger Abbey.  Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance).  The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite.  They are wealthy ""English Christians.""

There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners.  Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient."

Sheila Benton; has a trust account that says if she embarasses the family name she will loose her money.  The story opens with Sheila and her boyfriend (who by the way is married) doing drugs.  He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.  Without telling the end of the story and trial, the search for Shelia;s father is unclear ....would I read another book, yes probably."

One of the feature that I like about this earbuds because it block out background noise and wire cord are well made. For the price, I love it has built-in microphone to answer your calls, a switch to toggle between iPhone or android and a sliding volume control. It can only allow you to adjust music volume only so in order to skip it to next song which you need to do on your phone. Also, they don't hurt my ears after a long-wear. Earbuds and headphones that is more bulky tend to hurt my ears because they fit too full in my ears but this earbuds doesn't hurt my ears at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good pair of earbuds that are really cheap with good sound quailty.

Pros:
* Ultra-soft ErogoFit in-ear earbuds
* Multipurpose Remote: Volume control, music switching, hands-free call, open Siri in iPhones
* Built-in microphone and answer key: allowing hands-free calling

About a week ago, I had a problem where it wasn't assembled properly and turned on anyway: it should not have been able to do this, it damaged itself and posed a safety hazard in doing so.  I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.

A company can't entirely prevent malfunctions.  This is the best customer service experience I have had in years.  I recommend KitchenAid products on the strength of this experience alone."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These are very comfy shoes! I usually wear a 10 and bought a 10 in these and they fit perfectly.  I have medium wide feet and they are roomy and comfortable. The goga mat insole is what makes this shoe I think. It has a really nice rubbery bounce feel under my feet. I have been having problems with my feet hurting from not enough cushion in my old running shoes and these have been a really nice change with my feet not hurting after my walks ( I walk about 5-6 miles a day on gravel trails, and the gravel usually pokes up into the bottom of my shoes and bruises my feet but these protected me pretty good).  I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides. These looked better in person than I thought and the mesh look is different looking in person (it seems like it's more of a fabric texture and less of a large mesh material than it looks like in the picture, although they seem breathable enough, they don't have large mesh holes like I originally pictured). I'm still not in love with the way these look, but they are good for taking out on the trails, and it's kind of nice to have a new pair of shoes I don't mind getting dirty (instead of the pretty kind of new shoes that I really only want to save for the gym and places they won't get messed up :)
Overall, definitely happy with these runners."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"What an amazing way to end this series!

When we first where introduced to Asa, I was not impressed, he was the con man, a bad brother and up to no good. It was in Rome's book that he really started coming around and I really started to like him. I wanted him to turn things around, and he was trying really hard to be a better person. In this book, I just totally feel for him and my heart was at times breaking for him. He was trying so hard, but also so resigned to the fact that he was not a good person, that he was going to screw up and disappoint the people in his life. I loved Royal, she was strong and fierce, she was struggling with some of the same issues as Asa in the beginning, but otherwise, she was a woman that knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go after it, would not comprise who she was and her morals for anyone. She was strong and yet vulnerable. I really loved them together and their potential to be together.

Jay did a beautiful job wrapping this series up and giving everyone their happily ever after. I have loved every book, every Marked Man, every woman that has been their match. This has been an amazing series and I have enjoyed being on this wild ride with these guys. I am sad that it is over, but also can't wait to see what she has in store for us next!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I have read a lot of Elizabeth Lennox books and am looking forward to The Alfieri Saga.  This book was fast paced and had a 13 years later epilogue that I LOVED.

(her saying her son was born in January & he was calculating their 1 night stand was in September... come on.. it take 9-10 mos of pregnancy not 3-4)( I was a little confused when she said he was the only man she had been with, but yet near the beginning her thinking was no man before or after him had come close to him... confusing). Even though I was confused a time or two I still liked the book, the characters, and the happy ever after outcome. I look forward to the next books that surround their children's love life."

I have purchased 4 pairs of these pants over the last year or so and they are by far my most favorite dress pants.  They look great right out of the dryer and sheds wrinkles easily.

So, I guess I'll just go on.  I don't know if I'm going to read the next one.  I have a feeling I'm going to read the next one.  I don't know.  I just hope it's worth reading.

I am a HUGE fan of Ms. King, and I hope she continues to write better books.  I will be reading the next book in the series.

I use it with my Kindle Paperwhite (2014). The fit isn't perfect, as it is designed for the Fire, but it works just fine. Inside there is a tab in each of the corners to hold down the tablet. Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around. But only just barely, and since it ships with a styrofoam insert (to keep its shape during shipping), I use that for extra protection and it works great. So I definitely recommend this for other Kindle Paperwhite (or equivalent-sized e-reader) owners."

I thought the authors did a great job with the family history, it was factual without being boring and long-winded.  If anyone knows of a good book about W.A. Clark, please let me know.  Huguette herself is, of course, a mystery and extremely intriguing.  I was most interested in the close relationship she shared with her mother, Anna, and how Hugette's life changed after her death.  Also, the side bits of conversation with Huguette were worked in very well and added a bit of a different perspective.  All in all, a great read, and highly recommended."

Adam Carolla has a biting wit and exceptional powers of observation when it comes to the Decline of the Real American Male. Many of his stories are hilarious and I had a hard time putting the book down.  What I found interesting, however, was that there was more to it than just being funny.  The mass victimization psychosis that our population is experiencing, along with a sense of learned helplessness, is actually a pretty serious problem.  This book made me want to grab my tool box and go fix something.  It is certainly a worthwhile read and would make an excellent gift."

The problem is that plastics are so ubiquitous and cheap.  How do you replace them without - at the very least - going broke?

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.  Yes, my kid has to remember to bring them home.  But they don't break easily, and, because I can microwave in them, they save on dishwashing, too.

It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes.

Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you.

Electronics_5,3.0,CG,"The spreader portion was useless, it kept the camera in the lens.

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.  The zoom lens is a bit too wide, and it's not very sharp.  I think the Sony lens will make a great lens for portraits, but it won't do much with a camera.  The camera is very small, and I'd be happy with it if it had a wider rangefinder.

She also gives enough of history, so the reader understands the broader context, in this case, as in many of her books, WWII. Helen, I think, wants the reader to understand all the ramifications for choices for good or evil, and that true evil really does exist. Her heroes, thankfully, are always the good guys, which makes for an entertaining, as well as educational, read."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I honestly don't know what took me so long to get one of these remotes!  It is fantastic and setup was quite easy as well.  After my initial remote setup I had to plug it into the iMac one more time to make a setting adjustment.  That is all it took, and everything is working fine.

For large fingers the center of the remote could be a little cumbersome.  The buttons seem a little close to me and I have medium sized hands.  That is the only tiny issue.

The remote emits a stronger signal than all the original remotes is seems!  I can point it anywhere and it will do the job.

DVR controls work perfectly.  The button layout is different ( DVR remote) but took me a few minutes to figure them out and get use to it.

I purchased the Refurbished remote.  Why pay more its JUST a remote!  It looks brand new to me!"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"It felt fresh. With all this dark, creepy dystopia on the market today, here's a lighter dystopian book with just as much adventure, romance, and all-around awesomeness! It really didn't feel dystopian at all. There were still the big problems of war and incurable disease, but the characters still had hope, which made the biggest difference.

I LOVED all the characters! The good guys were good, the bad guys were bad, and the stepmother remained in the middle of the two. I don't want to say that they felt unrealistic, but they weren't completely realistic either. Except for Cinder, all the characters felt like they were slight caricatures of their true selves. This wasn't a bad thing, though. It just made it kind of easier to point out ""Oh, he's prince charming! And that's the evil person! Oh, and don't forget the fairy god-droid!""

I know everyone's been talking about that really predictable plot twist. Yeah--it was predictable. And knowing beforehand that there was a predictable twist like that meant that the first time it was even mentioned I totally figured it out.
Luckily, that didn't take away from the story at all! The plot never lost excitement, and kept me on my toes throughout it all!

I would recommend this book to ANYONE in a heartbeat! It's a fairy tale for the girly girls, with a strong willed cyborg heroine for the not-so-girly girls, and it's got robots and mind-controlling moon people for all the boys!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This novella is a very good addition to the Nemesis Unlimited series. Ada has been given an assignment to gather evidence against an aristocratic couple. This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"UPDATE: Shortly after writing this review I was contacted by i-BLASON customer support who informed me that they have sent me out a replacement case. That is awesome and deserves 5 stars in itself! Hopefully I just got a bad one and it won't happen again.

If I would have written this review immediately after receiving the cover I would have given it 5 stars because it does fit good. I got the frost since it is semi-transparent and still shows the apple logo on the back. I noticed today that all four corners are cracking. I have not dropped my iPad or mishandled it in any way. I even keep it in a Griffen sleeve for extra protection. I see that other reviewers are reporting the same issue.

I will wait for something else to come out but for now it is still protecting my iPad well enough but I am afraid that the corners are going to gradually chip away and expose the metal."

The rollercoaster is never ending and this time is very sad.  Have your tissues ready.

I wear them in the winter, and they are warm and cozy.  The shoe is a bit too big for me, so I'm going to try something else.  I'm planning to order another pair of these, as I'm on my feet all day long, so I don't have to worry about how the shoe feels.  I'm not sure how long I'll wear them, but I'll keep wearing them, because I love the comfort.  I'm sure they'll last for years, and I'll keep them for those I can wear to work,"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"One size fitting does not fit all!

This item is definitely not what the average-sized female would consider as a 1-size fit.  I am 5'7"", 36 DDD and have a long torso.  I started not to even bother trying it on because it looks tiny coming out of the package.  Once I had it on, I found that the elastic under the bust area does reach where it needs to and the stretch of the fabric didn't make it feel like it was too small.  It even reached far enough to cover my backside but wasn't long enough to wear into a public place such as a store/coffee shop, etc., after a day at the beach.  The material is soft, slinky, inviting and very comfortable, even despite the fact that I thought it was too small.  The colors are bright, vibrant and cheerful.  Despite the fact that it was too short for my long torso, there is a generous cut to the item which gave a nice flowy feel to it.  I'm keeping it to pass on to my 5'4"" daughter whom I'm sure will love it!  A great value at this price, especially for the right sized person."

No complaints at all except of course the manual is quite useless, but the menu is reasonably intuitive so just go with it. I like it so much after seeing what is does I went back on Amazon to get one for my truck, to my dismay the same item had jumped $20 or 50% in price. Sorry, I like it but not enough to pay 50% more a few days later. So searching around on Amazon I found a Foneso Dashboard blackbox that looked identical in the picture except it is blue on the front side. Specs all looked the same and it was slightly less $ and Amazon being wonderful like they are I decided to try it. Virtually the same thing slightly different menu and symbols, but every bit as good as this one. The choice is yours, just be sure to buy from Amazon so if you get a bad one or a fake as some have said they got you can return it"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Another great BDB book.  What I love about JR Ward is the fact that she introduces these main characters in earlier books so when the book finally comes up for them, they are already pretty developed and then you pop right into the story.  the way she twists it around and brings in stories on existing Brothers is also great.  Some series books will have the main characters and then you never see them again.  Not so with this series.  I keep thinking where is she going to go with this now, and she keeps surprising us.  Great read but you need to have read the priors to understand what is going on."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"A great first book to begin ones journey with the ancient Vikings fascinating age of expansion from the 700s to 1100s. Thanks to their Vikings ships, they covered great geographical areas by crossing oceans and sailing up river routes. Sure they were ferocious warriors to start with when exploring new lands, but they loved peace and harmony as well as evidenced by their successful integration with natives through matrimony, conversion to Christianity, peaceful trading and adopting local customs and assuming local names.  Thanks to archeology and artefacts scattered in all the lands they covered, we know today they were so well integrated in the lands they ventured to that their graves intermingled with the graves of the natives.

An insight into the ancient Vikings will throw great light onto what we witness of Scandinavian societies today. Their pride and joy is deeply rooted in their path to Christianity and the bridges they built with the natives of many lands."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"Overall this is a great pair of shoes. I've worn them for a couple of hours and they are still comfortable. The only negative is the soles are a little tighter than I expected. It's a little hard to get them on with socks. The shoe is a bit too tight for me to wear them with socks. If I had to go up a size I would probably order a half size up. However, I think I would prefer a half size up since I don't have a lot of room to wear them with socks. I'm sure I could have gotten a size up if I wanted to. I'm not a big fan of the color and the soles are a little too tight for me. I've had a few pairs of this brand before, but I have no regrets. They are very well made and they're very well made. I would highly recommend this brand. My daughter loves these shoes. She loves them."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum for the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped working as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now."

I'm not going to say anything about the other books in this series, but I'll tell you this:  The last book was a bit of a shock, and I was very disappointed.  The other books were very good, but the story was lacking.  The main character, Daisy, is a very good-looking, sweet, determined, independent woman who had a hard time with her mother.

I found that hard to do on my wireless network for some reason.  It doesn't necessarily do HD content, all that well though, but I think you have to get the more expensive one to do that. But it did allow me to hard wire my media center extenders to my network as well as my media center PC.  I have a much more secure connection now.  I do get speeds of about 40mbps most of the time, and I am reasonably satisfied with that since that is a pretty big jump in performance."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed.
If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing. If anything I hope this will turn a few people on to the lovely music of Chet Baker."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have to say it's been years since I have felt so engaged reading a book.  Oddly, I saw the movie before buying the Kindle book; and in the middle of reading, I decided to watch the movie again.  I suspect it won't be long and I will read the book once again.

This is a thinking person's book and story, and thus isn't for everyone.  But the mastery of the writing is so highly evocative that you ""see"" the book as you read it.  Incredibly deep characters, mesmerizing continuity of theme (which some might argue about, given that the book is written as segments contributing to a ""writ large"" story), the ability to make you laugh, cry and inevitably sigh, ""yes.""

I had never heard of David Mitchell before reading this book.  But it only took me 500+ pages to realize what an important writer and artistic voice he is.

I am a strong supporter of public libraries, and have downloaded Kindle versions of books to determine if I will actually buy the book.  In the case of Cloud Atlas, it was a no-brainer.  I finished Cloud Atlas today and immediately downloaded ""Ghostwritten"" from my local library.  I suspect it won't be long and my Kindle cloud will have all of his works in it.

If you think and therefore read, and read to think, Cloud Atlas will keep your mind whirling.  It's a must-read piece of literature. It's a truly gripping story."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with my digital camera, the card has already eliminated the nuisance of running out of storage on my video camera (with 16GB of internal storage) while traveling/sightseeing.

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots. In addition to cameras, this Centon SD card is also compatible with some models of Android smartphones.

Two thumbs up for the Centon SD card!"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is an excellently written book - fast paced and engaging. Jon Krakauer is adept at interweaving the history of the LDS Church with a present day story of ""violent faith"".

Based on a ""revelation"" he received from God, Ron Lafferty and his brother Dan brutally murdered Brenda Lafferty (their sister-in-law) and her 15-month old daughter, Erica. The two brothers never spoke of having remorse for what they did. In fact, Dan openly admits to the murder, claiming God wanted him to do it. It is a haunting notion: that someone's thoughts could be so twisted as to let them believe that by killing another human being they were doing the work of God. Krakauer latches onto this idea and examines exactly what would lead a person to commit murder in present day America because of religious believe.

Though the topic is fascinating, it is important to keep in mind that Krakauer only focuses on the extreme parts of Mormonism. He talks about Fundamentalists who openly practice polygamy and the physical and sexual abuse that goes on in those communities. Not all Mormon's are polygamists and not all Mormon's actively seek ""blood atonement"" against their enemies; it is only a small percentage that is so extreme. Before judging all Mormons too harshly remember, every religion has its radicals. Therefore if you do decide to pick up ""Under the Banner of Heaven"", read it with a grain of salt."

Lots of compliments, until I said ""They look like clown shoes."" Everyone laughed, agreed, but we still like them. However, I will note that the right boot feels a half size larger than the left, which is not usual for my shoes. (In other words, it's not my feet that are different sizes.)
All said, I am keeping them but won't be buying another pair in another color, as I had considered doing before trying them ... unless they become $15 less expensive, and then I'll deal with the size issue."

To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America. The only real gripe with this pourover method is the filters. At the mercy of these pricey things. I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Wallace Thurman was an influential figure in the Harlem Renaissance, the era of heightened creativity in writing, art and music that arose in Harlem following World War I. In Thurman's short life he wrote novels, plays, poems and essays and started two magazines. A bohemian who drank and partied hard, he died at age thirty-two of tuberculosis.

The Blacker the Berry, first published in 1929, gives a fascinating picture of Harlem in the 1920s with its vibrant street life, easy sex, wild house-rent parties and black cabarets frequented by thrill-seeking whites.

The story follows the many tribulations of young Emma Lou Morgan. The tragedy of her life is not being black, but too black. Her light-skinned mother is ashamed of her dark-skinned daughter.

An alien in her own family, Emma Lou is universally snubbed in her hometown of Boise, Idaho, where high browns and half whites rule Negro society. Even at college in Los Angeles, the colored sorority won't have her. Harlem is her last chance to find a haven from the color snobbery within her own race.

Emma Lou, however, brings her troubles with her wherever she goes, for she too is a color snob. She'll fall for a light-colored good-for-nothing over an intelligent black man every time. Emma Lou's experiences make painful reading at times, but eventually open her eyes and give her new hope.

Wallace Thurman was an acute social critic, and his satirical talent is full strength in The Blacker the Berry."

The bishop had heard knocking at around 4am and when he opened the front door and found the basket on his front step, he was shocked.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars."

It is a story about a man who had a baby, a woman who had a child, a man who had a wife, and a woman who had a son. I found that the characters in the book were very interesting and the story was interesting and interesting and there were a lot of twists and turns.

She was dressed just like the witch, completely down to the long orange braid, and the animals on the broom.  Room on the Broom was a big hit when it was read in class.  It's cleverly written in rhyme, and my granddaughter now knows Room on the Broom by heart."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I read this book on Unlimited & really enjoyed it. Although my preference is for paranormal, I occasionally read contemporary romance. The characters were good, if not particularly original. The plot also wasn't overly original, but it set up another book in the series well. This is easy to read romance, nothing too demanding. It has solid writing with good proofing. I will read the next one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This turned out to be a great deal, even though the bracelets are not really sized for a small wrist (I have experimented with other uses as an armband or anklet, with varying results). The larger ones are very thick but the design (on all four, actually) is visually attractive. They come individually wrapped but all packaged in one bag. The cord binding them is not stiff, so even though it only moves on one side, the loose ends hang down nicely rather than getting in the way of things."

The only thing I can think of is that it would be nice if the device had a USB port to charge it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great suit, the quality is excellent.  This suit does help to hide flaws in your figure.  If you are a little thick in the tummy this will hide it well. (I am not sure if you have larger midriff if this would completly hide but I think it would help)The top is cut low and cups do not have underwire and padding is not removable.  If you need a little lift for your chest would have to purchase something to go into suit. I bought this for an upcoming vacation and am very pleased with the way I look in it.  If you have a few flaws that need hidding this suit may be a good choice.
I also bought the bottoms in same color (teal is a very nice color)
Note: This is not a amzaon verified purchase, I did purchase from another site but I have written other reviews on merchandise purchased from Amazon so decided to put one up on this suit since I was so pleased with it."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I loved the book, hated the hype. I know it can't be helped but I'm always afraid of people who thrust Bridges of Madison County at me and told me, with tears in their eyes, that it would CHANGE MY LIFE...okay, it did not. End of that subject.
But it seemed like LB would appeal to those same readers.
So I quickly bought LB as soon as I saw the hype begin. It was a wondeful first novel by a talented writer. Her heaven sounds good enough to me that I might have to reconsider my whole ""heaven"" thing. Besides, she put dogs in her heaven so the book got an automatic 3 stars just for that.
Susie, the murdered girl narrator is believable and without a shred of self pity or angst. Her story unfolds much like you would expect it to as she describes the aftermath of disaster. I loved the grandma, was puzzled by the mother and thought she captured the sister, brother and murderer very well. I was glad she didn't go into any kind of poor murderer he had a terrible life, thing. Ya gotta figure he did. And I'm glad she stuck it to him in the end...
She really captured my interest with her portrayal of the father and I was touched by his travels through grief, despair, revenge and losses...
Enjoy the book. It's well under the hype radar but well worth it as a good read."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This was a good story and I really liked the characters but this read more like a really long Prologue rather than an actual full book. The chapters seemed to break in random places as if someone just counted every so many pages and placed a chapter there. There wasn't really a concrete story being told. It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail. I actually really liked that about the book but it had no real ending to it. I looked up what the series is about and it seems that this is a lead in for the 2nd book. I don't know if I liked it enough to buy the rest of the series. I did enjoy it and it has a unique group of characters, rather than the young sexy hearth throb the hero is actually an older  widower in his 50's with adult children and the heroine is a widowed woman in her 30's. I feel like this book is still a little on the premature side. I can't put my finger on it but the book felt lacking to me. I didn't fully understand the characters and their thoughts and feelings. I felt a little disconnected from where they were all coming from. Also the romance seemed rushed in the end and went from no love to instantly in love very quickly with no real lead in or gradual build up. Overall I enjoyed it but I think it still needs developing."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.  All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol."

I can't imagine a better way to sound than with a subwoofer. I'd highly recommend this subwoofer. I love this camera. I have it in a DSLR, and it is great. It is a great camera.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I was very excited to read this book. I have recently become the manager of a business and have been having a hard time trying to figure out how I should treat and deal with my staff. It's a small office and so we are have constant contact with each other and I have found it hard to strike the right balance between friend and boss. Many times I have felt uncomfortable when wanting to address something with one of my employees. This book has been invaluable to me in that it has given me a lot to think about and put into action. I like that there is a timeline so there are different questions to ask myself each day so that I just don't do a 180 in 24 hours. My employees may just walk out on me then!

This book really made me identify to myself why I am the boss, what skills I possess to help this business and to take ownership of that. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to work on their management skills!

The author asked me to read and review this book and I am so glad he did. This is my honest review and I highly recommend the book."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Not my normal reading genre.

No murder.
No thrills.
No adventure.
No elves.
No weapons.
No car chases.
No mystery.
No spaceships.
No enemies.
No cowboys & indians.
No horror.
No court scenes.
No trips to Heaven.
No trips to Hell.
No spiritual battles.
No angels.
No demons.

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I liked Conspiracy of Paper very much, but Liss is even more successful with The Coffee Trader.
The plot is extremely intricate, and the reader must work to stay with it, but the work pays off in a terrific resolution.
Though I admire Liss's attention to detail and historical veracity, what I most appreciate is that his characters are convincingly three-dimensional.  Few people are all good or all bad, yet the proliferation in modern fiction of characters who are no more than straw men is appalling.  Liss gives a reader characters that are convincing in their strengths, flaws, and manifold complexities.
All in all, this is one of the better suspense stories of recent years, and I recommend it without qualification."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've used this battery on a D50, D80 and D200. I bought 2 EN-EL3e's because most of my Nikon bodies provide very conservative battery power readings. If you are a Nikon user, you'll probably realize that Nikon has geared their Nikon digital camera bodies with memory card space and battery power meter with a ""glass is half empty"" approach. I was doing a shoot with my D80 and I thought I had a defective EN-EL3e because after 200 shots, the battery meter stated I had 44% battery power left. I ended up shooting well over 1000 shots and the meter was flickering from 30% to 60%. The same behaviour happened with my D50 and D200. Bottom line, Nikon's digital camera bodies have very inaccurate battery level meters. The EN-EL3e has a TON of juice on 1 charge and I am very pleased with it."

But, when I finally got my filter built, and slipped over the scope, I was a little shocked. the sun spots were so vivid, and the sun's surface is clearly quite turbulent. I also really like the coloration. I've seen photos taken with the Baeder film (which produces a white image) wherein the photographers used software to add some yellow color to their images. in the end, their images looked just like what you see through this black polymer.

I read about 20 boring, annoying pages over the course of four days, and then picked up an Agatha Christie, which took me a day to finish.  I just don't think this was well-written, and I don't mean the translation.  I mean the narrative.  Fiction 101 tells a writer to SHOW, NOT TELL.  Instead of making there be anything vivid, let alone convincing, about these people or the pathos of the situation, Larsson tells tells tells.  Additionally, as many have commented, Larsson spends so much time in exposition, there is no forward momentum.  As stated, I couldn't go beyond 20 pages."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Because the author gave me a copy of her book to review, Amazon will not say verified purchase. I started off reading this novel kind of slow, as I myself am also an author. I found this book from the fourth page on to be written with charm. On every page, there is a twist and turn that seems like it would really happen in real life. One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house. I could relate to growing up with houses that I thought were haunted and I remember going in them and running out because I was so scared. Eventually, everyone has to face something that they are not willing to. It'sa good read and I think anyone reading it will enjoy it."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed Dead Running very much. It had a great combination of action, romance, and witty dialogue.  There definitely were some obvious plot twists and turns but that just added to the book's charm- it was a fluffier suspense book with plenty of fun occurrences and tame romance to really engage the reader. I liked all the characters too which was a plus.

A couple of things for me that kept it from being a five star:  the ending did not have full closure, so I am assuming that there will have to be a follow-up book(s), otherwise everything is left to the imagination. That was a bummer. Second while the book was fun and I liked all the characters, Cassie was sometimes very immature. Her actions made me cring a few times.  It also annoyed me that for a person with a degree in the fitness and health industry, she did not really know her craft. Kind of made me feel like she was a bit of a dough-head and I did not want to feel that way about her.

Overall a great read if you are in the mood for something not so serious- a fun romantic suspense."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Taotronics Bike Phone Mount Bicycle Holder is a great peace of engineering, that is very versatile. Prior to buying the phone mount holder I placed my phone in a bum bag, when riding my road bike. The Taotronics phone mount holder has enabled me to change all this. Now my phone is mounted on my handle bars in front of me. During my 40km rides ""DownUnder"" (Sydney, Australia), where at times the ride can get rather bumpy, my phone sits securely clamped and strapped to the phone mount holder on my handle bars. I find it so much easier to use my phone when riding. Also, it is easier to listen to the feedback on my riding performance during my ride, from the downloaded app on my phone. This phone mount was purchased on 15th March 2017 and my wife was so impressed with it, she wanted one for her bike, which was purchased on 25th May 2017. The recommendation from the seller, to use the rubber strap before you put the holder part and the clamp together on the handle bars, was taken heed of. I recommend both the Taotronics Phone Mount Holder and seller Sunvalleytek. Regards Stephen."

Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."

If I want hot tea I just warm the mug up first with warm tapwater while I heat the boiling tea water and add loose tea to the strainer and snap it in the mug (it snaps sung, won't fall out on you). Then when I have water for tea just slowly pour the water over the tea and Wahla! Remove the strainer basket and away you go. If you want infused water, put your fruit or herbs in the mug, snap on the filter and add your water. The fruit stays in the water and you only get flavored water. No junk gets by the filter/strainer basket! AWESOME!! Note: everything BUT the bamboo lid is dishwasher safe. No instructions came with the item. But It is packaged nicely and pretty straight forward.

The dress fits me perfectly. I ordered mine in 3X. When I buy dresses similar to this style from Lane Bryant. I normally get the 18/20 size. The size chart of this dress list the 3X as suitable for 22W/24W. I guessed that the dress might run small... and in my case. I guessed right.
I wanted some brighter colors and the teal is really pretty and the red is a very bright and vibrant.
I like how light weight it is. It's very thin and that will keep me nice and cool especially in the summer heat. It's machine washable so I don't have to worry about a dry cleaning bill.
You can add a scarf or nice jacket to jazz it up for the fall you could even add leggings and/or a long sleeved shirt underneath for wearing it in cooler weather.
The only drawback is that the V-Neck plunges a bit too much, so I'll have to always wear a tank top underneath to keep my bra from showing.
It's not too long either. It falls right above the top of my feet, so I can wear it with sandals or heels. I'm extremely happy with this garment and highly recommend it.

You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I picked up Without a Doubt on a whim and the book God's were smiling on me that day, because this one is a real gem!  This mother-daughter writing team really has some magic working for them if this entry is any indication.  The story of a New York homicide detective, Darius, who is deeply unhappy after the loss of his wife and son.  He visits his cousin in Macon, GA for a wedding and gets much more than he bargained for.  Instantly enthralled with a woman he meets, Andee, there are walls up that keep him at bay for a reason.  A really well-written and suspenseful story that would make a riveting movie.  Can't wait to read more from this talented pair."

Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef! I have not yet used the peelers (I have my ""go to"" potato peeler I will not cheat on). This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I had the privilege of reviewing this book before its release. You might be familiar with Sam's Thomas Hunt Series. The Hunt for Eros is slightly different from her previous series, but it will intrigue you from the beginning with its fast paced, fun, sexy, and adventurous plot. This scavenger hunt for a priceless work of art, will have you routing for its rescue. Highly recommended read for those who love a thrill seeking romance.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products."

Except for the author's annoying habit of over using names in conversation, I felt they were very well written.  So I decided I would buy the paperback of Demon Angel and read how they all began.  I was bitterly disappointed.  While reading I got the sense that I was plodding around in a thick fog, going nowhere.  The behavior of both Lillith and Hugh made little sense and I am currently at page 188 and realize I am receiving no pleasure reading this book, and so I have given up.  If you have not begun this series, I strongly recommend you skip this book and begin with Demon Moon.  Ms. Brooks explains enough in future books that you won't miss out on anything having missed Demon Angel.  I'm hoping the reason this book is not available on kindle is because the author has plans to rewrite it into something worthy of the other excellent books in this series."

She commits herself to Dylan but is back in town for less than a day and admits being in love with the other guy, which the readers didn't know a whole lot about.

Although this book was slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapters to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eyes bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing?

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I'm not sure if I'd really call this ""high gain"", but thanks to its antenna and USB extension cord, it does a better job of pulling in wi-fi signals than your typical ""nano"" or compact USB wi-fi adapter. The box contains the adapter, which looks like an oversize USB flash drive; screw-on antenna, a USB extension cord that's maybe 2 feet long, and a mini CD containing the drivers.

One minuscule quibble: Like most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with a cap intended to protect the USB plug when the adapter is not in use. And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.

The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.

As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager."

I read this book in the middle of the night, and it was a very enjoyable read. It was hard to put down, and I can't wait to see what happens next!I love a book that starts with the most beautiful idea and then lets you think about how you could accomplish it. This book is a must read for any creative mind!I couldn't put this book down. I loved it."

REVIEW:
This smoking hot paranormal romance had all the aspects of the Carpathian novels we have grown to love. The danger and intrigue at times left me breathless, but that was tempered well with the love and friendship loaded on the pages. This story also had a fun group of friends that I believed had been together for years. I enjoyed Skylers strength and determination that was clearly shown without ever losing her softness.  Dimitri was perfect for her and the romance flowed smoothly. All in all a well written story that was very hard to put down and I am still lost in their world.

I had a similar set before and they have improved, but it is not the same as the ones I bought. I am very disappointed.This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!  I gave it to her last year and it was so much more than I expected.  She loved it!  She loves it!I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review. I received it as a gift for my daughter, she is in her second year of college. She is a very happy camper and loves it. It is a very good quality product and looks great in her room. It is a nice size for a few bathroom shower stalls. I wish it had been a little larger for a larger bathroom. I wish it had a small curtain rod. I would have given it a 5.5.My daughter loves this mattress. She slept on it on the other side of her bed. It was amazing how it made her feel when she was on it. I was so happy I ordered this mattress. It is very comfortable and soft. It is not the best quality but it is a great price.I am pleased with the quality of this product.  I was very skeptical that it would be a good idea to use it as a mat for my son's bedroom, but it is sturdy and a great value.

This little bags take that smell out within about a week! Amazing and successful. I prefer using natural unscented products for cleaning, bathing, laundry, etc., and these little gems definitely fill the bill for destroying annoying odors. Another plus with these are they can be ""recharged"" just by placing them in the sun for the prescribed time."

When his cousin, living out in the Alaskan Bush, invites him to visit and assist in building a cabin, Campbell can't turn down the offer. In fact, he decides to take his eldest daughter, Aidan, a young teen, along. The two make three separate and unforgettable trips, which are narrated in this story. Awe, beauty and danger everywhere, he's written it in a way that allows the reader to be right there on the trips.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book presented a business parable which provided a nice framing device for the principles on how to be a Go-giver instead of a Go-Getter. The story is a vehicle to share the Authors 5 Laws of Stratospheric Success which involve expressing gratitude, and being generous to others.

The lessons were a good reminder that getting ahead in business (or anything else worthwhile) does not have to come at the expense of others and the value of networking.

If did feel that the narrative got a little to wrapped up in how clever the author felt the mysteries of identities of the The Connector and the Friday Guest were. The author also used the lesson of appearances can be deceiving to justify several contrived relationships between characters, which made the ending feel somewhat forced.

A very feel good story with a good theme but the narrative itself suffered."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I think I own about 10 pair of Cushe shoes, probably more. They are about the only brand of casual shoes I wear. I happened to find some by accident, and it took all of about 2 hours to break them in and for them to mold perfectly to my foot. Cushe shoes are the ultimate comfort and support. My feet never tire in them. I used to wear different brands all of the time, but I don't see any need to shop around for comfort since I found Cushe. There are enough styles to cover many looks. If you have not tried them and want a super comfortable shoe, obviously since I have 10 pair I'm sold on them.
Only reason for 4 stars. The shoes I received do NOT have the type of laces shown, which was a major factor in deciding to buy this shoe. I have another pair in a different color that does have the shown lace, and I like them much better. I'm a bit disappointed because the laces shown look better and you don't have to mess with tying them. I will probably write the seller and ask if they can send me the laces shown. But, it's not really worth the hassle of retuning the shoes. If Cushe wasn't such a great product I would have slammed this, but I just can't!"

The hat portion slides onto a headband. The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely.
The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."

This book is a great resource for anyone interested in becoming a better writer. This is a great book for anyone who is looking to find a way to get better at writing and writing. I think this book will make a great resource to anyone who is interested in learning more about writing. This is a great book for any college student. The book is easy to read, and provides an interesting and enlightening look at the subject matter. It is a book that you can read at your leisure, and you will be glad you did. This was a great book for those of us who are not religious. I was a little skeptical at first but after reading the reviews I was a little more convinced. It was very well written and was funny. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a Christian. I love this book. I have read all the books in the series and would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the characters. This is the only book I would have rated this high in any of them.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Let me start off by telling you that this story is not your typical romance story. Is it even possible to be able to find romance between an addict and a former addict ? In this story there are quite a few dark moments that have you holding your breath and praying and hoping for the best. What I loved about this story is that it provides you with the past and present time so you can fully understand what happened in Teagans life that got her to that moment. You start to understand Teagan more, or at least I did.

I thought this story was very well done. I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was. It was a very good book, even through its dark moments and because of its dark and raw moments in time"

Those looking for good support should look elsewhere, but for those who seek evening comfort at home after a long day in underwires, this bra is perfect. I did order two sizes up from my normal 36 (I ordered a 40) because it was too binding at a smaller size. I am 5'2"" and about 125 lbs. my torso is short so that may have been why a smaller size was binding on me. The front of the bra is about five inches long and rests over my ribs, so I just keep the bottom two hooks unfastened and all is well, but i did order a larger size than normal for me.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work. The soles, glue, and stitching are all in fine shape even after all that abuse."

The Haier TV is a vast improvement over the Coby model: it has a nice attractive look and actually takes up less room than the Coby did, although their screen sizes are identical.  The picture quality is very impressive for such a little TV, although as other reviewers have mentioned, the audio quality is HORRIBLE.  If you intend to watch this TV often, I would suggest investing in a nice inexpensive pair of computer speakers....but this may not be necessary for casual viewing of news or weather channels.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This historical thriller revolves around the Earl of Walden and his family, who all become involved in a life and death struggle the outcome of which could have a serious influence on World War 1.

Walden receives a visit from Churchill, asking for help negotiating with Russia about alliances in the forthcoming War.  Walden feels this is an exciting opportunity to further his career, whilst his Russian wife finds it brings back unwanted memories of a love she has tried to put behind her.  Meanwhile their daughter is busy thinking about being presented to the King and Queen and her first Season  whilst beginning to discover that the real world is not quite as her sheltered upbringing has led her to believe.

Alongside the family activities in London and at their country estate,  the suffragettes are fighting for womens rights, a Russia anarchist has arrived to assassinate the Russian delegate Walden is negotiating with, and interesting discussions are being held on the moving of European boundaries to satisfy political needs.

I found this book disappointing.  The writing style, as usual with Ken Follett, is excellent, and the story moves along at a steady pace.  However I never found myself particularly interested in the main characters.  Many of the historical detail from that time are fascinating ; the social norms of aristocratic women, the suffragettes and the political upheavals going on.  So, its a nice easy read, with interesting background information."

But it has some issues.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

But I discovered that once a station was program into the radio there was no way to blank it out. All you can do is program another station in that pre-set. In other words there was no way to clear all or any of the pre-sets. I tried and tried all to no avail.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"You Don't Have to Be a Star by Susan May Warren -- Love this inspirational romantic story!  This author has done it again!  I love the stories that she weaves while also imparting Christian character, principles and God's Truths.  Her characters are full of life with the same problems that many of us face, in one area or another of our lives.  Her characters are complex and the story line, itself, grabs your attention from the beginning and holds it until the last page is read.  Her stories are not preachy but clearly demonstrate the love of God to each reader.  Her characters do not lead perfect lives but learn to rely upon the Lord.  I love her books and always find a message from God to me within its pages (no not verbal).  The very first book of hers that I read was, ""Where There's Smoke,"" which originally started her Montana Fire Series.  I have read almost everyone of her books and love them all."

Tri legs are a standard in photography because they add stability compared smaller 4 leg base. Why would Fotodiox change this to a 4 leg design is beyond me. Also why have they not updated the photos, could it be because they know most photographers will look at other products if they do. It's nice that the legs fold but poor design that putting the spigot on the the top leg takes away the ability to fold the legs for storage and transport.

I was a little concerned about the ending. I really do hope it didn't come as a disappointment. I was hoping that it would have a happy ending. I loved how the author didn't let us read all of the other books in the series. I really hope that we get to see more of them.

I started this book ready to resist liking Arden.  While she is still not my favorite character in this series, the author did a phenomenal job making her softer and vulnerable while staying true to her ""real' personality.  I certainly understood her better by the end of the book and look forward to the author unveiling the rest of her complicated layers. I think the good doctor is just what she needed in more ways than one.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.  What I really enjoyed and respected the most was the way these couples dealt with conflict when it arose, textbook for classy and mature adults.  This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.  You simply cannot read this book and not wish you were part of this group's inner circle.

My favorite line in the book is delivered by my favorite man in this series, Cesar, he tells Athena ""You are the diamond Dee has been longing to treasure"".

This book is well written with its depth and characterization. The drama is not overdone (thank you) and the pace is perfect.  I feel as though I know this group of friends.  The men of this series are the type of men that every girl dreams of one day making their very own.  Well done.  I do have a question......Who is up next?"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot.
With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered.
Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband?
As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years.
Ms. Wainscott's latest is a masterpiece of mystery, chock full of suspense, and brimming with romantic attraction. Readers unfamiliar with this rising star's work will definitely want to check out this latest suspenseful novel."

It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.

The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar..."

This was a replacement for a standard suction cup. I did not need a suction cup.

I had to replace a couple of the basic ones, but it worked fine.

The only thing I would change is that it was a little bit too large for my machine. I found it was a bit too small for the machine and it would not fit on the standard suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The author builds an emotional tale with well-developed characters.  I think it is worth cautioning readers that are sensitive to the issue of rape that a central element of the story is a woman dealing with her feelings after such an event. The heartbreak and turmoil of such medieval pillaging is part of the nature of Saxon attacks on a rural Roman villa in England. The tale is of love and triumph but real in the brutal reality of the period.

With the death of the men of the farm, the women are left to survive and go on living. They struggle to survive from meager food stuffs while rival powers exert influence on the villa women.  The story has sad elements but Diana, the eldest surviving daughter of the land owner, captures your heart with her courage.

This is a giving, loving, romance story with the thorns and pains that are real in life.

I have to say I like the cover art too."

This is nothing joyful in this story.  There are times of less pain but there is always pain.  Getting to know the heroine is worth reading the book for even though it is not an easy book to read.  The hero, in my opinion, is an arrogant know-it-all that I could not accept for the majority of the story.  I liked him marginally better by the end.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.
The plot really had a lot of potential, the story would have been better had it focused on the plot and kept the romance clean and simple. Less is usually more."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Funny, I just sold a Bulova Precisionist chronograph (9B175) this past week, and then ended up getting this one!  The other Bulova was a bit too large, heavy, and chunky for my tastes.  This one, however, is very nicely done!!

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

All in all, this is a fine watch for $200+ dollars!!  I'm happy to add it to my collection."

On top of that Adam and Ace have somewhat resolved their issues and if they could just get Alicia on board it would be great.

Ace is now having less time to spend with them due to work and their surprise weekend ends this part with yet another cliffy.... I honestly DID NOT expect Ace to react how he did. I am a little let down with him. He seems to want the chances but never wants to give the benefit of the doubt to anyone else. We shall see if this new struggle smooths over easily or not.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I just received this book 10 minutes ago so I am unable to comment on how thoroughly it covers the basics. It appears to have a lot of detail on how to use the program.

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. If you have a previous version of Quickbooks and want to know any gotcha's about what happens to your data while upgrading (or how to get your data migrated into the new version) this is not the guide. If you are concerned about advanced topics such as 64-bit systems or server-based versus desktop-based or how to lock it down so everyone in the company doesn't have to be a super-user just to use the software this type of information does not appear to be in this book. There is some coverage on managing users in chapter 26 but little on how to make multi-user work so more than one person can use the software at a time and what the issues/limitations are,

In summary - if you have already got your computer guy/gal to install and set it up for you, this looks to be the right book for you. If you have an unopened box or are trying to understand what the install instructions mean, it is not and you will need additional info."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Meet Jordan a sassy girl that cant be touched by a male, without flipping out. Meet Blake a very rich not so stuck up guy that has a goal and it happens to be Jordan. What a fun love story this is!! Thinking her ""love"" life is done and over, Jordon isn't ready for her reaction to Blake. Upon meeting him she is rude and outright mean to him. It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself.
Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons.
The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call.
I really loved all the characters in this book. His parents, Dacy her BFF. This is one of a very few that made me cry happy tears. A job well done to the author.

I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Hackneyed with sparse flashes of inspiration would be my synopsis of this title. The author's work is a broad-stroke pastiche of stock types stitched together with boilerplate. The action scenes are well put together, but the whole book starts to feel repetitive, largely because of the ""tell not show"" style. The author is at pains to throw out hints of a larger world, but nothing seems to gel. The character names, seemingly ripped from a child's daydream, are particularly jarring if you're trying to take any of this seriously. Feels kind of like Neil Gaiman's stuff does in his lesser works, forced and unsatisfying."

Yet our habits, many would say, rule us. They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.

This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.

A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them.
Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.

The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.

A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Slow and boring. The only reason why I made it through this book is because I told myself I wouldn't read anything else until this was done since I paid for it. Nothing happens in this book. There were a maybe two slightly-intense scenes that were over after one page. The author jumped from person to person so quickly it makes your head spin, and it was hard to keep track who was who. There was no electricity between Salander and Blomkvist, in fact they had hardly anything to do with each other. The author didn't let you inside anyone's heads, including the main characters. It was all very matter-of-factly written, with no emotion to speak of. Overall, a very frustrating and downright boring book to read. If there's another one, I will probably not bother."

I can wear it on my feet all day long without being nervous or nervous about it. I am extremely happy with this top.This is a great wallet for the price. It is very light weight, and the wallet is very well made.

The only complaint I have is that the leather is a little too soft. It seems to be made of some sort of leather, which is to say, not real leather.

I had to return it because it was too hard to get it on. I have a large head and this is not a problem. I would have liked to have gotten a size larger, but I really don't like the leather.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is a great courtroom drama, with detailed analysis of the characters involved. No character is a stereotype, with some approaching pure evil and others somewhat good, but all the characters are believable and their behavior consistent. Turk is very adept at providing just the right level of detail to convey his message. The story and its ending are groaningly realistic. The good guys don't always win, and evil sometimes prevails. Perverted and unusual sex are on display, but not graphic. The message is delivered in good taste, but still delivered. The courtroom action itself is spell-binding, and makes it impossible to break from reading. Give this book a read, you won't be disappointed."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Hey! you know that Chance scouted out the location of the canyon when he was haveing her plane connections delayed and rerouted.
I loved the way L. Howard kept the character of Chance true to form from one story to the next.
Also if John is old enough to have a girlfriend he is old enough to get caught up in some machinations that needs Zane and Chance to rescue him and set him on the path of his two uncles'- besides Zane needs to produce another daughter and Chance one to put them into a hilarious competition [aided and abetted by their wives]
there are still enough up close stories to be told with Mary and Wolf still in the background -- and lets go back in time to Michael's and Josh's stories.
I, along with so many others, agree that this has been the best family series ever written - with all of the ladies well matched with the Mackenzie men - this is a family that can't stand still - these are classics -
With Sunny willing to put her life on the line for Chance, she does a great job of breaking down his reserve and teaching him to love.  Love only comes from giving.
I do love a woman who is willing to take care of her own self-preservation [grin] and dragging a man into realizing her worth.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"My MacBook Pro gets hot. I have to run it with a cooling fan or it will start slowing down. (In order to keep itself from overheating, Macs manage the temperature by adding more idle processes into the queue until it's cooled down!)

I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).

When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.

This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.

Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.

BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point."

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Cons:
Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened.

Tragedy sets the two brothers on a road trip together, but this is no buddy story about bonding while traveling.  It is one character's realization that his life is going nowhere and that he needs to find a way to change that before he gets to the point where his rut is inevitable.  Along the way, his brother is going through a journey of his own, full of guilt and fear and desperation for his role in a terrible accident.

Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on your desk.

The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.

The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.  The great thing about these USB docks versus the old school docks are that you can really place them anywhere and just hook it up to your computer with a USB cable.  This version is a winner.

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The first one I got stopped working after a couple days while watching a movie.  I was in the middle of watching a move and the two speakers for high frequencies stopped working.  After testing all other components and different content I determined it was the center channel itself.

There wasn't a lot of mention of this online so I figured it was a freak incident.  Luckily it happened within the return period an Amazon swiftly replaced the unit.

Since then, paired with the L890 speakers I have it has been amazing.  Great balance and full featured sound."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Even after thinking on it a while after I finished reading, I still have mixed feelings about this book.  The characters were likable, especially Cade, but there were parts of the story that just didn't work for me.  The main thing was some of the dialogue between Cade and Brook.  I hate to say it, but it was juvenile at times, and very repetitive.

As I said, I liked Cade.  I really felt bad for him, and the way he seemed to be led on my Brook, and just waiting around for her to make a decision that would effect their possible future together.  I did start liking the book more at the end, and was rooting for Cade and Brook to finally get their HEA.

The book was long, and not being completely invested in the story until close to the end, it took me longer than usual to read, so to get to the end and see that there would be another book?  I was pretty disappointed.  I still can't decide if I liked the story enough to want to see what happens next."

I am so looking forward to the next book in this series!I had no idea that this book would be one of my favorite books.  The writing style is a bit too choppy and it just doesn't flow the way I like it.  I liked the ending, but I didn't like the way it ended.  I would have liked to see more of the men's side, but I felt like it was too slow going.  There were a couple of errors, but that was okay.  I would have liked to see"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"While I saw the movie before listening to the audiobook, I must say that I still really enjoy the main character. He's one of those guys you love to hate, but he's trying so hard to do the right thing, even if it means defending a scumbag who deserves a lot worse. Of course, since I had seen the movie already, I had an idea how it was going to end, but couldn't remember the specifics. Perhaps thats a measure of a great crime drama: all the misdirection makes it difficult to know whodunit, allowing future rereads to be enjoyable.

But, back to the main character, Mickey Haller, I think one of the reasons this book was a breeze to listen to was because the main characters POV is so well written. You can tell that he has some baggage from his father, which is partly why he defends everyone, regardless if they're guilty or not. The fact that Haller knows his way around the legal system and uses it to his advantage to even get the guilty an innocent ruling just shows that he takes pride in his work, even if it labels him as someone who keeps the crime on the streets.

The plus to this audiobook was also the narrator, who was awesome in bringing all the different characters to life with his voice acting. Even if the story is told from the point of view of the eponymous Lincoln Lawyer, there are plenty of interesting people in this book, and each one certainly has a different sound to them. Its the attention to these details that differentiates a narrator just reading a book to you and a voice actor who can bring the events happening in the words hes speaking to life.

A great start to an interesting crime drama series, I give The Lincoln Lawyer 4.0 stars out of 5."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The book for review is Legacy of Fear by Ryshia Kennie. It falls in the genre of mystery with romance tossed in.

The setting is Honk King. Andra, a young woman who now lives here gets the shock of her life when she finds her neighbor across the hall dead. Did they mean to get Andra?

Arriving on the seen is Max, a linguist who is trying to solve a puzzle that has landed in his lap in the form of a doll with the message, Find my heart. Find my girl. Why is he set to locate Andra? He needs her to crack the code of the message and the reason why it was set to him.

This starts off the pair in finding a mythical village that is run by and populated strictly by women. They need to learn a lost language to solve this mystery. Toss in men who are after you at ever turn, the plight of our characters just intensifies.

I do have one part of the book that left me flat. This is not a big book. I get the fact that Max and Andra who start off as friends start to like each other to where they get romantic. While I am not someone who likes reading romance in a book, if it is done in the right amount I am okay with this. The amount of scenes where we saw these characters expressing their feelings for each other and their interludes to me was too much and less would have been just as effective and the point would have been made just as well. I wanted to get on to the mystery and not turn a page and yet again see them being lovey toward each other.

This was a quick read, and you could easily read it in a short time. I loved the story line of the village, language and how it was all tied into a doll that was delivered to Max. That really was fun to read. Overall, this is a good read and for the price you truly cant go wrong."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This CPU was too fast.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I have had my Escort for a few weeks. I upgraded from a whistler. Right away I noticed a decrease in false alarms. This to me was amazing as the whistler liked to go off at every turn. The alarm sounds of the Escort are much less nerve racking and sounds loudly at first but will then cut the volume down. Another cool thing is the smart cord. This cord has a led only when it is plugged into the radar detector and has another led for when it is detecting radar. Again not in an annoying way. The escort has a dark mode which almost shuts all the led lights off so as not to distract you at night but the audibles will sounds and the smart cord led will light up but since it is down by the cigarette lighter and not in your face it does not distract you from the road. Overall I give this 5 stars hands down compared to the radar detectors I have had in the past.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I recently wrote a review on the Robert Leckie book, Helmet for my Pillow, which in my view, was a narrative of what he did in the war in the Pacific. On the other hand, E.B. Sledge in his book, With the Old Breed, wrote about what he witnessed in the war in the Pacific. For those readers who want to know about what the Marines had to deal with against the Japanese, read the latter. It is down right ""chilling"",  and at the same time, a very serious read about Marine combat in the Pacific theater."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"The title gives you the short version, now here comes the longer one.  I'm reading Ms. Scottoline's works in order, so this is number 5.  In Rough Justice, she reprises Mary DiNunzio's character from book 1 and if my notes are right, (Ms.) Bennie Rosata's from book 3 -- which is nice because we're really getting inside these character's personalities which adds to the fun.  The basic premise this time is that a guest hot-shot lawyer from out of town, Marta Richter, has just heard from her client, who, thanks to Marta's hard work, is heading toward a self-defense acquittal for killing an alleged carjacker, a confession that it was murder after all.  She immediately spends the rest of the book trying to get back at him (not too sure about the ""legality"" of that), with help from Bennie's associates Mary and Judy.  The plot is actually quite good, with a lot of twists and turns, culminating in a very good ending that had me turning pages late into the night.  A number of additional corpses prevent this from being all sweetness and light, yet I think the outcome seemed fitting.  My only gripe was that 2/3 of the book took place during such a bitter and deep snowstorm that roads were closed and cities crippled.  Yet Marta manages to drive back and forth from Philly to the Jersey shore (!), with all kinds of shenanigans there, while the troops back at the law firm are out all night pulling the same stunts, even interviewing people at 2 o'clock in the morning!
Anyhow, ""Rough"" is a welcome addition to the growing Scottoline repertoire; I'll certainly be back for more, and I can overlook a little bit of unlikely traipsing around by the women for a story this entertaining!  Try it."

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This book is typical of the genre and is filled with angst, smoking hot scenes and complete and utter denial and misunderstandings. It covers all of the bases that fans have come to expect. Two people who are complete opposites find themselves attracted to each other but have a million reasons why they can't be together.

This is the first book in the Lost Boys series and it is safe to say that Devlin is a little lost and a whole lot bad. Sometimes I find myself really getting behind this kind of character but there was something about Devlin that was holding me back. I didn't love him as much as I would have liked and I found that a little disappointing. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly was off but it was definitely something. Perhaps it was some of his questionable moves. I'm not sure. He just didn't seem as sincere in regards to Rena as I would have liked. Rena was also a little on the weak side for my liking as well. Their relationship lacked the depth that I was craving.

Although I did find the characters a tiny bit weak it was still an entertaining and easy book to read. I think there is promise for future instalments of this series."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"At first I thought this book was taking place along time ago, because being from the USA, it's hard to think women are not even close to being equals with men,  in many parts of the world. It was shocking when the story was talking about planes and phones, that I got a wake up call this was a romance story for now. I personally thought  Hajar's reaction to his trauma was right on. People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type. The romance builds, which I also liked, they just don't fall head over heels for each other and have sex right away."

Goldberg has a very good understanding of what is going on in the world today, so I can see why he is one of the most important players in the American political system today.

I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading the next book in Goldberg's ""Kingdom Coming"".

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the life of a great nation.I have read many of the Harry Potter books, but this one is by far the best.

The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life. The battery life is about 8 hours, and it will charge the phone right up to the day of the trip. It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it on the first day of the trip. The battery life is good, but it is not the best. It will charge the phone up to about 8 hours, but it does not last very long. I would recommend it for anyone looking to recharge their phone. I have no complaints about this. Works well, and the case is well made. Would buy again. This is a great little speaker for the price. The sound is good. The only complaint I have is that the audio cable seems to break when you push it, which is annoying. The sound quality is not great. I would have preferred a little more bass. Overall, it is a great little speaker. I would recommend it. Very nice. I just wish it had a bit more volume control. I've had a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems. The USB 3. 0 port is a bit flimsy, but that's not a huge problem since the USB 2."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."

My heart was beating so fast and I had to put the book down a few times, I was so nervous about what was going to happen. This book takes on a serious situation and I thought L.G. Castillo handled it brilliantly. Seeing Cassie deal with what happened was heartbreaking and watching her over come it was empowering. This book had me yelling at both characters and praying that things would finally go right for them. Since I read this on a kindle at 71% I literally had to put the book down and take a moment to recover from what I had read. My heart just couldn't take anymore and the emotions I had, it was overwhelming but I needed to make sure these characters were going to be ok...they needed to be ok!

The Story of Cody and Cassie is heartbreaking and beautiful. I can't tell you enough how this book with so few pages can give you so much and make you feel like you read an entire novel with so many feels, good and bad. This series is amazing, she did a phenomenal job telling this story. This is the last book in the Cody and Cassie story and I loved how everything come to a close. This book/series is AMAZING!!!!!

The story is about thirteen year old Nita, who goes into a library to hide from bullies, and comes across a training book on  how to be a wizard.  After reading through it, she discovers that she has many of the qualifications, so she decides to give it a shot, though she suspects some sort of prank.  In her exploriations, she meets up with Kit, a twelve year old boy in basicly the same situation as her, and they decide to team up and  be partner wizards.  As I read this book, I found myself likeing it more and more, as I enjoyed the sense of magic, and identified  strongly with the main character.  Though some of the magic spells they were doing got a little bit tedious, the book was generaly very exiting and well written with somewhat of a sad ending."

It is not as gory as the other books in the series.  The only thing that I found was the fact that it was written in the first person.  I found it annoying when I had to read it over and over.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I installed this msata in my Lenovo Ideapad Y580.  Installation was easy (thank you, Crucial, for including screws with this drive!) and the machine recognized the drive immediately.  After a little work, I was able to install Ubuntu on this drive and dual-boot between Linux and Windows 8.1.  Booting into Linux is super fast, even compared to regular Linux boot times.

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light."

I normally wear large and XL so I ordered the XXL.  I have to have 2 people help with the zipper in the back in order to zip it and the top portion is smaller than the rest, but it fits okay. Also, if you are larger up top, definitely go for the bigger size. The material is stretchy which is the only reason the dress fit. It is very nicely made material and look wise. As most of the reviews say, you'll definitely want to order the petticoat as the shortness of it made me cringe & I am only 5'3""."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups. The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming for the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away! So far I estimate that he has thrown away 1/4 waffle for every 6 waffles he has made...so the batter won't make as many as before. still looking for the appropriate measure). It's heavy duty & hope it lasts for years!!"

Although it doesn't feel like a 17th-century King's throne, and although it is recommended to not be used by anyone over 225 lbs, my 6'3"" 200+ lb frame fits into this chair quite comfortable, with space on either side.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.  For now, a solid 4 stars for a major upgrade over my last office chair!"

The book is well written and will give you a good idea of what evolution is like.Great book.  I found it very interesting to read about the military and the military in the 19th century.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in military history and history of the United States.  Highly recommend this book.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a book club.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in history.I have read this book numerous times and loved it.  It is an entertaining read"
Books_5,5.0,CG,"great book, but buy it if you love the series. I will keep reading it!Very good.I read this book in the middle"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book was most definitely five stars for me because I have loved Adam since the very first book of the series. Adam is so passionate and such a dominant that he protects all the women in his life. All the women he cares about. And he doesn't take no for an answer.
I had to write the author and tell her that I'm so excited for the very next book. At the very end of Adam, enough said, I hope that the two people that are discussed at the party are the next book I think that would be absolutely wonderful.

Summertimes over so I won't call this a beach read. I would say this book is definitely one that you could curl up with a nice blanket some hot chocolate, apple cider, or smooth Scotch and enjoy the read."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This was an excellent novel with many threads of plot lines.  I felt the author did an excellent job not only in the writing of the story, but in the story itself.

The imagery was detailed without becoming tedious. You could picture the characters and the landscapes/buildings without becoming bogged down with pages & pages of description.

The mystery was well told without giving away early secrets. I was fooled until 3/4 of the way through, or more.

I did like the interaction between Tristan and Lily, when they were hot, they were hot!!  Ended with a little bit of a cliffhanger, curious on where this story is going to go if there is a book 3."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I enjoyed the storyline, compelling. The threat from any organization has one jumping at shadows and Corchado proves that he is not above the rest when it presents itself to him. I did enjoy the author's history because it parallels my own. I can empathize And true to the case that very few of us imigrants still hold on to hope that the situation in Mexico will improve for the better. It must.

The one thing that kept me from rating this book better was the constant use of translating the 'Mexicanisms' everywhere it is used. Even some that were translated already chapters before. It felt like the author was looking for wordcount buildup. The flow of the story is constantly interrupted by the translated repetitions. Like a street with too many unecessary speed humps you eventually would avoid, I stopped reading halfway through. But I do intend to pick it up down the line to finish the read. I am curious if the author got fed to the tigers."

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

Hard to put down, this laugh-out-loud-until-tears-run-down-your-face book has a character that somehow manages to survive dead bodies, bad hair, dead bodies, her grandmother, bombs, a healthy libido, and more dead bodies as she searches for local favorite turned fugitive Uncle Mo.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Got this as our older router/wireless AP was having difficulty with having XP and Win7 machines connected at the same time. This one has been great for all devices, solid signal strength about 30 feet beyond the perimeter of the house (brick). Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue. But sometimes it is just the router (have tested directly from the modem) and both wireless and wired connections all fail. Haven't tried a firmware update yet as honestly... we have just gotten used to having to power cycle it occasionally and it is a pretty quick fix."

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed.  The main character, a young American boy named Nicholas, is not the typical kid.  Instead, he is a young man who is raised by a strong family.  He is a very special person, and it is his father who is a mentor to him.  Nicholas is very talented, and the story is very well told.  The story is told in a very specific way, and it is very difficult to imagine it in a fiction format.  Instead, I found it very interesting to read the stories told by the characters.

The plot of the book was very interesting, and the characters were believable.  I enjoyed the way they developed their personalities.  They were both very real people, and I found it very interesting to read about their lives.  The main character, who is not always very popular with the general public, is also very popular with the general public, and his personality and background were also very interesting.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"American Pru Parke is now a permanent resident in England and is now planning her wedding to Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Pearse. However, before they become husband and wife, Pru agrees to complete a short-term assignment at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This assignment will challenge her gardening knowledge in a new way. She has hired to determine if a journal was actually written by botanist and explorer Archibald Menzies. Not everyone at the garden is happy with Prus involvement and when a difficult co-worker is killed, Pru herself becomes one of the main suspects.

I feel fortunate to have discovered author Marty Wingates cozy novels. This is the third book in the Potting Shed mysteries and it doesnt disappoint. Pru balances the stress of a new assignment, planning a wedding, and then investigating a murder with her usual intelligence and grace. She is an interesting main character and I love reading about her relationship with Christopher. The premise of this installment, as well as the investigation, is equally interesting. I enjoyed this book and am eager to see what will happen next for Pru and Christopher. Fans of Ellery Adams or Hazel Holt will enjoy the style and setting of this charming series.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"""Destroyer Angel"" made me sad. It's not only the violent, depressing story, but also the fact that this may be the last Anna Pigeon novel I read. I have been reading Nevada Barr's books for many years now and have been disappointed in the dark turn this series has taken. I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series, which could never be accused of being ""cozies"", but included wonderful descriptions of National Parks and a variety of realistic characters. I thought the premise of this story being a story of survival sounded intriguing, so I gave it a try. After finishing the book, I can say I liked it better than recent installments such as ""The Rope"", but didn't like it nearly as well as earlier books in this series.

I liked the vivid characterizations of the female characters and descriptions of the setting, but the male villains are interchangeable and their actions are appalling. Having the story told from different points of view added some interest, but also added redundancy and slowed the pace of the book. Some may enjoy this as a story of good vs. evil, but it's not my kind of story and even the great character of Anna Pigeon couldn't save it for me. The author has obviously chosen to take this series in a new direction, so it looks like we may be parting ways."

Definitely not but it was never given the chance to live and learn. Sad."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"What a delightful short story this is! Just what I needed - a feel good, romantic, Christmas story.

The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)

This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.

Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?

The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.

The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.

My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?

All in all a great short read which left me with a huge smile on my face when I finished it."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"The story flashes back and forth between the beginning of the 20th century and today; something I don't like. However, it wasn't too much of a distraction. My problem with the story is development of the characters and the total ""disappearance"" of story threads (WHAT was the purpose of the body bag on the dock and how did that play out?). There are characters that just don't make sense, like the hostility of the housekeeper (what was that all about?), the peeping tom proclivities of the butler and the bitchiness of the second wife (which wasn't even discovered until the end of the book (WHERE did that come from?)

I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Watching a friend's vacation slides may be an agreeable way to spend an evening, but Laurie R. King tests readers' patience with the same technique when she sends Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, to ""The Moor.""

The title refers to Dartmoor, nearly 400 square miles of fields, hills and treacherous marshes in the southwest of England. Conan Doyle set ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" there, and King uses a rumored reappearance of the hound as the pretext for drawing her sleuthing couple there. They're summoned by the eccentric clergyman, author and hymn writer (""Onward Christian Soldiers"") Sabine Baring-Gould, now nearly 90 and in failing health.

But before the inquiry gets underway, we're given a long dissertation from Mrs. Holmes about Baring-Gould and Dartmoor. Between the suspicious death of a local who wandered off the straight and familiar and the discovery of a body in the good minister's lake, there's nearly 200 pages of Russell reading Baring-Gould's books, Russell talking with the man and Russell riding about the countryside and chatting up the locals. Getting to the heart of the hound mystery takes up the last hundred pages, with remarkably little of the suspense which the novel advertises."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Xinran traveled across China in 2005-06 seeking out the men and women who had experienced the vast changes of the modern era. She tells the stories of 20 ordinary people, average age in their 70's.

Unfortunately, the information volunteered by these people is limited - partly because of their likely lack of broader knowledge, and mostly due to cultural reticence.  As early as the second millennium B.C., a Chinese criminal's family was punished as harshly as the criminal himself. Around 100 B.C. the people were grouped in units of 5 and 10 households, carrying out mutual surveillance and mutually responsible for each other's conduct. In the case of minor offenses, the criminal's family would be exterminated to between 3 - 5 degrees of association; with serious offenses this was extended to 9 - 10. This principle remained a mainstay of the Chinese judicial system until 1911, and also gave rise to powerful traditions of clan loyalty and fear of speaking out openly that is still an inhibition today.

Even media in today's China base reporting in line with this fear. Interviewees are often ""led"" to follow the central ideology of the party and to express personal views defined by these principles.

Thus, Xinran's accounts from those in the Cultural Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, the Long March, etc. is not able to convey the immensity of these tragedies.

Notheless, some of the interviews were of particular interest. One first involved a teacher at a Gobi Desert construction/military site. She received no raises for 30 years, supervised self-study until 11 P.M., and sometimes helped the children home during severe weather. Desks were made from mud covered with straw.

Altogether, incredible indicators of internal strength and stoicism. However, for broader perspectives I recommend ""Mao,"" by Jung Chang, and ""Chinese Lessons,"" by John Pomfret."

Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft."

I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years.

Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

***One thing that did bother me a bit, you can definitely tell the author isn't American as there were quite a few words and phrases that didn't make sense for a story that was taking place in the US. It didn't really detract from the story but did throw me for a loop."

But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!"

Books_5,5.0,CG,"I've been reading Sir Terry Pratchett's books for a long time, and I'm pretty sure that I have had a similar experience.  The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of young women who are going to kill him.  The young woman is a fourteen-year-old girl, and the group of women is so obsessed with killing her that they have to take her away from her.  They all have plans to kill her, and they all get together.  The story starts out fairly straightforward, with a young woman in a wheelchair being abducted and killed.  She doesn't have a lot of tools, but she is a fairly skilled fighter and she does a good job of keeping herself safe.  She's also a very clever, intelligent woman, and the group of women are quite good at making sure that the children are safe, too.  I really liked that the group of women were mostly young people, but they also had a lot of good qualities, such as being very intelligent and strong, so they would be very able to handle situations, and they were a bit stubborn about it.  I loved that the story was fairly straightforward, and I was quite impressed with how"

My only complaint with this dock is the length of the extension cables coming out of the dock. They are simple pass-through cables, letting you plug your device cables into the ports on your macbook without needing to take apart the dock every time you need to change a cable. For things like USB, its perfect. However, the cables are all 2+ feet long. It is excessive. The thick bunch of white cables coming out of the back of the dock is difficult to manage and keep out of the way. I would have preferred to have cables only a few inches long, so that I can plug my cables in close to the back of the dock."

I usually wear a 9. 5 in leggings but this was perfect. The material is soft and very soft and I can wear it all day. The fabric is very soft and nice quality.

The chain itself is very small, and the inside of the chain is stretched out.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.  The chain itself is very pretty, and the color is a very pretty blue.  I've had the chain for a few months now, and I think it's going to last a long time.  The material is very light, and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had it in a while, but I'm sure I'll be getting it in the next couple of weeks.  The reason I bought this pair was because the sizing is off.  I didn't like the color at all, and it's not the best looking chain I've ever had.  I'm still wearing it, but I don't really like it.  It's pretty cute, but I'm not sure how it'll hold up.

I'm 5'4"", 130lbs, and I ordered a large.  It fit perfectly, and I ordered a large in a large.  I don't think it will hold up to washing, but it's definitely a little snug.  I bought a small and it fit fine.  It is a bit small for my liking, but it still works well for"

This book is excellent for those who want to learn English as a foreign language and also for those who want to learn to write.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn English as a foreign language.This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a book that you should read.This is a very good book. I like the fact that I don't have to deal with the emotional pain of having to deal with a child's loss. It is very touching for a child who is facing such loss. I love the fact that the author was able to bring the characters to life, and the story is very touching. The characters were well developed, and the story was very true to life.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This book's biggest accomplishment is reminding one what a great work of art Nabakov's masterpiece is.

My main problem with Tampa was that the main character did come across as a believable human being.  Whereas Humbert Humbert for all his deviant predilections was often a relateable  character, Celeste, the sexual-predator narrator and overwhelmingly dominant figure of Tampa, struck me as a one note, sex-addled sociopath; all the other characters in the book are too peripheral to engage much of the reader's attention.

Tampa is filled with detailed and uninteresting sex scenes.  The main interest is wondering how Celete's downfall will be brought about.  I hoped Celeste's ensuing public disgrace and trial to turn to a Bonfire of the Vanities type spectacle but that section of the book apparently occupied little of the author's attention because it sped by perfunctorily.

I was drawn to Tampa initially by enthusiastic reviews in credible sources such as Slate.  I wonder if much of this enthusiasm was the result of the phenomenon of male critics being automatically wowed and over impressed when female artists frankly address female sexuality (cf. Liz Phair).  Lisa Zeidner's review in the Washington Post (available online as of this writing) seemed a more accurate assessment of Tampa.

One may wonder why I gave Tampa even three stars.  First of all, I'm a generous grader when it comes to books.  Second of all, it did contains several humorous passages and passages of well wrought writing.  Third of all, despite its flaws, I'll remember it.  Lastly the author deserves some credit for daring the comparison to a canonical masterwork and inspiring one to reread its literary inspiration."

The screen is not super sensitive and sometimes it takes a few try to change the volume or move around the iPod menu to change a playlist. I haven't noticed any tears in the armband material and it has held up well to my various workouts in the gym and on the courts. Solid product, good price. If any issues crop up (good or bad) I will edit review as necessary."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Dell laptops are not as evil as the 3 lower comments make them seem.  It takes some basic user knowledge to get accustomed with the product.  There is no need to 'knock' Dell down because of a bad user experience.

Blue screens are usually caused by bad programming or writing of software.  Blue screens have codes that say ""error: xxx""  where XXX is the name and code of the problem.  MOST bluescreens are MEMORY PARITY problems -- bad programming of software.

Dell not responding to customer issues is absurd.  I have never had that experience in the 15 years I've been contacting Dell for any situation.

My suggestion to people who have ""so much trouble"" is to figure out why others do not.  You may not realize that installing and uninstalling through the Windows installer is the proper way to install.  Installing through each individual programs installer is WRONG.  This advice will fix 9% of problems out there dealing with ""my laptop is slow now!"""
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Choose Yourself & Love You More by Author Lucie Jones

If there is a genre of book that I can identify with...it is an inspirational one!  The Introduction to ""Choose Yourself & Love You More"" is excellent as it quickly addresses the real issue and the difficulties we encounter in learning to love ourselves. It also stresses the need for internal positive self-talk. For many people, it is not so simple to look in the mirror and love what they see and who they are. As stated by Author Lucie Jones, it is very true that ""learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all"".  I'll even go one step further...if you don't love yourself you will never learn to truly love others. Charity really does begin at home. Therefore, I totally agree with her suggestion to have a better look at ourselves and learn to truly value who we are...

From the very first page right to the last, I can clearly see what this talented author's goals are and why she decided to pen this little gem of a self-help booklet. To love ourselves is not a crime...it is a necessity in order to positively change our self-image and move forward. Yes...we all have flaws as mentioned, however, they should not decrease our self-worth and affect how we live our lives. As this motivational author stresses, the benefits of self-love will enhance our opportunities to have better relationships. If we stop beating ourselves up...we will attract people who add to our positive dynamic which will result in healthier relationships. Who could ask for anything more? Great suggestions are given to help us follow a new direction and turn our lives around. It is an excellent place to start!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Chasing Lilacs is an impressive debut novel for author Carla Stewart. The author takes us back to 1958 and puts us in a small Texas community, and into the mind and heart of Sammie Tucker, an almost thirteen-year-old girl.

Life isn't as simple as you think it must have been ""back then."" Sammie's mother suffers with mental issues, and when she commits suicide, Sammie's world is filled with loss and confusion. Then her disgruntled aunt shows up to help ""care"" for Sammie, and things get even messier. It's a good thing that Sammie has a loving father - not to mention other townspeople who look out for her. There's her outspoken best friend, a new boy who comes to live with his uncle, and her mentors - the woman next door who raises birds, and an elderly widower who has his own secrets.

Although Sammie is a young teen, I became totally involved with the character. This story pulled me in emotionally, while it also provided surprising plot twists. I was whisked into nostalgia and a time when life was perhaps a bit slower, but the pace of the story kept me turning the pages.

Chasing Lilacs touches on the subject of mental illness and shock treatments. Not necessarily a happy topic. But is also an uplifting story of hope and forgiveness. It reminds us that even when we don't initially see it - God is still in control and working on our behalf.

I'm looking forward to reading Carla Stewart's next release."

I couldn't find a comfortable position.  After only using it for a few hours, my shins were slightly bruised! (Purple veins were apparent)  I tried not to put too much weight on the knees/shins, but then my pelvic bones were in pain like I was on a bicycle for hours.  So I would put my weight back on my knees/shins, but then I would have pain in my shin - not so much in the knees.  I decided I couldn't work like this for 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."

This is a great series for the fans of sci-fi, and it will make you laugh and cry with every page.I love this book. I read it once a year and it was one of my favorite books of all time. I couldn't put it down. I will buy the next one. I love this series. I loved it and am reading it again.

I read this book one year ago and I had been reading it since. I enjoyed it so much I bought the next one. I read it again in a year and I have read it many times. I have never read any of the books on the series. I recommend reading this series if you like this series.

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

* * * * * 01.30.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

* * * * * 02.11.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

Trakdot is, without question, the worst purchase decision I've ever made, but at least I got my money back. Finally."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this especially for the backlit feature so I can find the buttons in the dark. Unfortunately, the backlight only stays on a few seconds after you press any button. There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.  This remotes costs a lot more than a non-backlit version of the same thing, the RC71, without the B, about 6 times as much."

I liked the setting, but I do wish some things had been explained in a bit more detail, like the Moonchildren.  I especially liked the use of words from ""our"" languages, altered to reflect the passage of time.  It's a detail many ""colony of earth"" sci-fi writers ignore or bungle.
I can't say the mystery enthralled me, I figured the second biggest mystery about half-way through the book.  The ""whodunnit"" part was weak, but this book is worth reading purely for the philosophy of the Triumphantes.

What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this book! It's full of adventure and courage with a good deal of history thrown in.

The Siege Winter opens during the brutal civil war between Stephen of Blois and Empress Mathilda, during which the common people suffered terribly from depredations on both sides. A young girl of the fens is brutally attacked and left for dead as she and her sisters flee the soldiers and brigands that prey on the locals.  She is rescued by Gwil and becomes Penda, a young boy. Together Gwil and Penda struggle to survive in the time when ""god and his saints slept"".

The story is recounted by an abbot on his deathbed to a young scribe. The character's are varied: Maud, a young noblewoman who is traded back and forth between the two sides in the war as if she was as much a piece of property as her actual property; William, Maud's stepson who is torn between devotion to his awful father and Maud; King Stephen and Empress Mathilda; and various other players. The action is constant, and is both mental and physical as the characters try to stay alive in the brutal war. And then there is the evil monk...who is he, and why does he have such power?

This is Ariana Franklin's last book; she died before it was completed and her daughter completed it. It's a wonderful book and a great tribute to her. I wish she were still around to write more great books!"

The characters seem real, as their considerations and doings are quite slow and not jumping to conclusions although for once I wanted the story to be longer.

Can't wait to read the next, but I hope Diesel is the one to go exploring, perhaps even secretly run away and get a cat girlfriend, as well as become more involved with solving the actual murder.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I definitely had a love, hate relationship with this  book. When I began to read  the book I wasn't very impressed at all. I couldn't really figure out who was who and what the story was really about. So I decided that I needed to continue on in order  to give a fair review. I'm so glad I did. The author has written a very intricate mystery that  kept me guessing throughout the book. The action is explosive and at times very intense.

Jake is a former Marine who has  a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings. I thought his  character was good and had lots of depth. He is smart, decisive, alert and had great instincts. He has a new job as a photojournalist. While following someone he inadvertently stumbles upon an assassin  at large. The assassin does  not like lawyers .  Jake seems to get one step ahead and then takes two steps back in this lively story. Who is the assassin? Why are lawyers being targeted?

I thought the assassin  was a brilliant character because he was so unpredictable. He reminds me of a ticking time bomb. You never know when it will go off but you know when it does , chaos follows. I liked the multidimensional, quirky and very unnerving characteristics he had. What I really like was how the assassin even controlled the people who hired him. With cutting words he was in control and calculated his every move. He does some very ingenious things to divert the attention away from him and on to Jake. Will Jake be able to prove who the assassin is? I recommend this book to mystery lovers who like intrigue and characters that jump off the pages with intensity.

Published in the May 18, 2009 issue of The New Yorker. I enjoyed this book well enough. It is a fascinating story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over a decade.

The Sherwood sounds at least as good as my Sony STR-DG720 in stereo mode and is probably more powerful.  I use this receiver with an HDTV, cd changer, and turntable.

I purchased a second Sherwood RX-4109 for about $90 with tax from electronics expo a couple of months ago.  I notice a very quiet hum from the speakers when the receiver is powered up and no signal is sent.  Once I press play on the CD player the hum disappears and can only be heard at extreme low volume.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Dead Wake by Erik Larson is an engaging account of the sinking of the Lusitania. Using both primary and secondary sources, Larson tells the story from all sides. Once finished, the reader better understands not only what happened on board, but inside the U-boat that sunk her, as well as the broader historical context.

This is the first book of Larson's that I've read, and it officially made me a fan. His narrative style is smooth and entertaining. He was able to tell the story of a huge event using the little moments that better help us connect to history. Another great feature of this book was getting to understand what was happening not just on board the Lusitania, but also on U-20, the U-boat that sank her. Learning about that particular tour reinforces one of the themes of this account - that a million little things happened that led to the sinking. If just one of these many things had changed, on either side, the Lusitania would simply be the name of another ship from a bygone era.

Anyone interested in history, WWI, maritime history, U-boat history, or the politics of war will enjoy this book. It is extremely well written and just as important, accessible to the average reader.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it? It was all about the game for me and on that level it delivered to the point of me wanting Wicks story next. Spices Rating: 3."

I confirmed my suspicions about the price when I went to a local Nike outlet, only to find it 30.00 cheaper.  Moreover, the sole wasn't cut in the same way of the original, i.e., in blocks intended to push apart to provide a natural shock impact.  Too narrow inside and out.  The sole outsole was wider in the original.  Maybe just buying the name here."

You never need to load a web site to check for drivers or updates with this device, it handles all of that for you.

The story was a bit slow for me.  The first couple chapters were very quick and the first couple were boring.  The author did a good job of making the characters believable.  The story was short and the story was fast paced.  I did get a bit frustrated with the hero and heroine.  I liked the heroine, but I did not like her.  I did get a bit annoyed with the hero.  I did get a little annoyed with the heroine.  I did not feel the hero was needed.  It was a good story and it kept me interested.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Large Canvas Duffel

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Fast. Borderline ridiculously fast.

These cards work decently in Mac Pro systems, with full CUDA support. Adobe products love them. However, the default firmware doesn't display Mac startup screens. Expect an unnerving period of black screen on boot. This also makes dual booting tricky - key commands aren't recognized during boot. I'm using BootChamp to switch over to bootcamp from Mac OS, it works wonders.

Also make sure to have your power situation sorted out, these cards require more than the Mac Pro board offers. I'm using a mulex plug adapter in addition to the board power."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2"

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Nothing special here. Good inexpensive headphones that are comfortable on your
ears and head.

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight
and yet do not fall off the head easily. Of course I am not exercising with
these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable
headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better
than these cups."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"It is a great book that never loses its power, the fact that it's in the 40th edition shows that this is one of the favorite books of all generations.
Here is a remark made by Ben Jackson, a professor of a professor at Stanford: Religious Studies at Stanford University put it:
""Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up. Tears fall in our lives like leaves from a tree. Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible. The more you blame the boy, the more you have to fault human existence. The more you blame the tree, the more you have to fault the very idea of parenting. Should the tree's giving be contingent on the boy's gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed. ""
So whoever that rated low for this book, I urge you to re-examine the angle you are reading this book.  Take a deep breath and see how much love you have received from the Big Tree in your lives--your parents, your friends, your Creator.

Buy this book for your children, for yourself."

Books_5,3.0,OR,The author could have gone into more depth about covert bigotry.  THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.  The author should be commended for presenting the bigotry on the part of Muslim's and that it cuts both ways.  Maybe more depth would have been possible if not as much time was spent on the grieving that takes place after you lose your spouse.

Writing style better than most with the occasional odd tense or participle. I would guess English is not original USA variety. So technically she could be correct while sounding off ... Example: he swimmed across the river and leant into the wind (shorter paraphrase) I would write as he swam across the river and leaned into the wind. For some reason that kept bugging me.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Chuck Palahniuk is most known as the author of Fight Club, the book that became the movie with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; and overnight Palahniuk had a cult following. Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.

This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.

From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores. This book will at times, turn your stomach, but will give you an understanding of the darkest side of human nature.

Readers beware! This book is like the fight club movie on super steroids.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Damien and Nikki are happily married and living life in domestic bliss. Or, at least they are until some unnamed, faceless person decides to play with Nikki and Damien again, by emailing them pictures of Damien in the throes of passion with someone else. But this nameless, faceless faction doesn't stop there. This person then moves on to sending Jamie, Nikki's best friend, a video of her in the throes with her former neighbor Douglas, who, unbeknownst to all his many conquests, films their sexual escapades on his laptop. Clearly, his video bank had been breeched, because, as it has been stated many times, Douglas wouldn't be able to hack his way out of a paper bag, even with directions.
But this huge annoyance (which isn't solved, btw, which leads me to believe that there will be more Damien and Nikki), is overshadowed by the true heart of the story. Valentines Day. Ms. Kenner certainly has a way with writing romance, and I can only hope that my first Valentines Day as a married woman with a man who owns pretty much the entire world is as romantic as Nikki's was with Damien.
Their celebration starts a few days early with a scavenger hunt, taking Nikki back to all of the places she and Damien have been to and loved in the past. The end result is a three day weekend at a private resort in the Bahamas, before coming back home to a few more surprises.
Despite having a few guesses as to who is behind this blackmail scheme, this was a very, very romantic book. Heavy on the between the sheets (or lounge chair) action.
We also got to, briefly, meet Jackson Steele, who is the first character in the Stark Universe series, which is coming out Spring of 2015.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

I had never experienced an accident before and was really impressed with the product. I ordered it from a local store and it arrived on time. I tried to use it on my car but it would not connect. I went to the local store and found the warning on the box, which was clearly written on the back of the package. I called the local police and they said it was not working. I called Amazon, and they said they could not ship to my location. I called the local police and they said it was a 3 day delay and the only way to contact them is to contact the police.

Filled this tumbler about 2/3 of the way with ice cubes and then filled with water yesterday at 1pm.  As of 12:15 this afternoon there was still a good chunk of ice left in the tumbler.  Have not yet tried it for hot liquids, but the cold performance is outstanding."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,I absolutely loved this book. Lucky might of needed a dose of reality a little bit. But overall it was a good book the only downfall was the plot you didn't see where the book was going until it was basically over.... and it finished with two diffrent deliemas. But I loved the fact i wasn't able to read it in a few hours.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows thats what everyone else does.

I am emotionally drained from this book. What fantastic writing. It's hard to tell you about the story without giving so much away. It's a story of struggle, love. and loss. This book will definitely have you taking a step back and thinking about what you truly believe, what you feel your purpose on this earth is, if there is even a purpose?

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

I purchased a copy of this book."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Mia has had a crush on her brother Blake's best friend Drew for years. About a year ago, Drew betrayed Blake and there were devastating consequences. When Drew finally returns to school, he's scared and not the same boy he was before. He has no friends and no confidence. Mia still sees the same boy she has crushed on for years and when they are assigned to the same class project and have to spend time together, they rekindle a friendship. They shouldn't be together but they can't fight the feelings they have for each other.

I enjoyed this book but it was a lot more depressing and sad than I was expecting. My feelings were kind of torn on Drew at first but my heart just broke for him. I can't imagine having to live with the kind of guilt that he carried. Mia was a good heroine, she had a good heart and was very sweet. There were a few small things that bothered me about this story but overall I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more by this author."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,"It is important to know that the author does not try to appeal to the masses. Instead, the story is told from the point of view of the reader.

I found it difficult to connect with the characters at all. I could not connect with the characters at all. I could not connect with the main characters. I could not connect"

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I got this cover with the idea of having a spare in case I messed up removing material to make the Qi adapter fit better (trying to reduce the lump it makes). It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish. If it's actually ""rubberized"", then it's the thinnest rubber coating I've ever seen. If I ordered this with the intention of not using it with a case and having a grippy rear cover, I'd be pretty upset. Really, for my own purposes this is a 5 star product, but I think if I didn't have this narrow use-case, I'd have called it 4 stars. So there ya go."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it for panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top or opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini or other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design or a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button for cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear or bottom and snaps the front or top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I needed white balloons specifically for a birthday party craft.  When these arrived, I was a little concerned because they looked very yellow.  I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."

It's a little thin, and it's not as big as the other TV's I've had, but the difference is substantial.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact TV that's very portable.I got this to replace my iMac, but I've had issues with it, not just the front and back ports, but the keyboard.  It's not the best keyboard, but it's ok.  I have a 13"" iMac, and it's only 9"" and 10"" and 5.6"" and 4."

At first, they may seem stiff or even a little tight around the width of the toes, this does however subside after one or two wears. After mine broke in, they became one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own. I can wear them all day while standing in the lab and I have very little discomfort. I definitely recommend buying a pair!"

I had a lot of fun with this book and I'm sure it will be a good read for all of us who want to learn about the human condition. The author does a great job of explaining how to do it, but the end result was a very difficult task. I was annoyed with the ending, as it made it seem as if the author was trying to drive the reader to get through the book, but he does a great job of explaining why it was a difficult task. As a writer, I was disappointed with the ending. It did not go as planned, and the ending was not at all what I expected."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Awesome, sexy, sassy, but most of all just heart warming."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Pros- Great picture, slim design, light weight, 3d conversion is pretty cool.
Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

Update 4/17/2013
Smart Hub still stinks.  Samsung, please push a complete software update to these models!!"

When I first got the skates I had a hard time turning corners but after loosening the axle a bit I still have trouble but its probably just because I need to practise.

The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.

For an affordable skate its good and from the looks of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates.

So basically size is good & fits good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Really cool concept, but it wouldn't cut my veggies all the way because there was a gap between the board and blade. I added a photo and you can clearly see the gap. Maybe I just got a faulty item? Maybe not. Also, in the video reviews I've seen the safety clip as a red piece but the one I received is black all over. Could be a fake. Would not recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The DGB-600BC was recently purchased because my previous unit was 8 years old and was starting to leak.  I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement through the years.  The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."

Electronics_5,2.0,CG,"I really debated between 2 of these, as they both fit nicely on my iPad mini. The other two fit very well. I also like the fact that the micro USB connector is just a little longer. The size of the adapter is nice and compact. The charger is also a bit smaller than I expected. I can use the mini with a USB charger in it for charging or charging with my iPad. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it's small enough to be easy to carry around, but I'm not sure that I would want to carry it around with me. Also, the cord is kind of stiff, but it's not bad. Overall, this is a great product for the money. I purchased this for my nephew's laptop and it works great."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I didn't like this book and I didn't like Sally Mann.  It was the most boring book I have read in a long time.  First of all, she really puts a great emphases on how smart she supposedly is.  She includes notes from elementary, high school and college teachers.  Pardon me while I yawn.

  This book is interspersed with photos, copies of notes and letters, and anything Mann throws in to make herself look good.  Her notoriety comes from the nude photos she took of her children growing up.  Many people found them sexually suggestive.  I found them exploitive but not really offensive.  Mann spends time defending herself on the photos calling herself nave time and time again.  That's OK for awhile but it gets tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all.  She is shocked that pedophiles are interested in them. Really?

  She also separates the pictures from the children.  She says the children are merely actors in the pictures and can keep the two separate identities apart even the 6 year old. Then she goes on to say how nice it is to have pictures of their childhood.  Which is it?  Are they separate or true depictions?

  After that she goes on to explore past relations.  She discusses her husband's parents murder/suicide.  Then she goes on to discuss kinfolk in even the more distant past.  This is when I lost complete interest and just thumbed through the rest of the book's pictures.  By then I was so turned off that I didn't even enjoy them.

  This was definitely not the book for me."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society. When you get into these books you will start noticing the author has a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the lines of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series.

Highly recommend the book to anyone who loves sci-fi / military books or just anyone looking for a great read in general."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!"

Cole is a biker with a conscience, he sees Angel in trouble at another club's party and feels the need to help her.  Poor Angel is just in the wrong place at the wrong time, her situation is bad and she is definitely saved from worse by Cole.

These two spend 9 days together, living, learning and having fun, until the floor drops out from under them.  Cole then has to decide what he wants to do with the rest of his life and Angel has to decide if she even wants Cole in hers anymore.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3."

Slight issue with the packaging, the little guide for the wire before the tube fell off during shipping but went back on after cutting the box open. Once that was back on it pulled perfectly without snags.

The wire is grey opposed to the light blue it looks like, not an issue for my attic, only noticed where the wire runs out of the wall."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"When Callan Carrigans father leaves the ranch to Court McAllister, Callan is shocked to say the least. For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

C.J Carmichael is one of my favourite romance authors, but this book disappointed me a lot."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I really enjoy the multiple story lines in this book. Nuts when you think the case has been solved you wonder what could possibly fill the remaining 150 or so pages.  Then you find out.  Harry Hole is his own toughest critic.  The tragic hero to whom we can all relate with his failures as spectacular as his successes.  Nesbo's story telling has steadily improved.  There is more flow and less confusion in the plot of this and the previous novel, The Snowman, which I also loved.  I have read all of the Harry Hole novels through this one and I am on to the next.

I am a big fan of ""Nordic Noir"" having read Larsson, Lars-Keppler, Adler-Olsen (except for his latest, The Marco Effect), and several of Indridason's Detective Erlendur novels:  Nesbo ranks high on the list."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I found this book both very confusing and sort of boring. And not only that, but it seemed to drag on endlessly. It took me until mid-way through the third chapter to even figure out that Juliet was a grieving widow, and why? And when she came home and found a naked man in her pool, she acted like she didn't even know who he was, and yet, he had been around for years while caring for her sick husband. I found that really, really odd. There was a lot of the inner thought process going on in both of their heads all through the book, and they weren't even complete thoughts, at that!

I have read books by this author before and enjoyed her humor and quirkiness, but not this time. I will continue to read her books in the future, though, because she normally does a fantastic job. IMO- I don't know why, but something just felt a bit off with this one."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Wicked for You is another delicious Wicked Lovers novel by Shayla Black. Mystery Mullins, daughter of a famous Hollywood actor/director and Axel Dillon, her hero rescuer, are the focus of this book 10 in the Wicked Lovers series. The characters were well developed and grew along with the story. There were a couple surprises along the way that I wasn't expecting, which were great!

Axel is a large and extremely sexy man/Dom. His attitude toward what he is, is very serious. I was surprised to see that even he has insecurities. As serious as he is about being a Dom, his feelings for Mystery are so deep that he finds it a constant struggle to keep a scene going instead of just making love to her. What ever they're doing, it's done with plenty of steam rolling off the pages! Mystery strikes me as not having a great deal of common sense. Not exactly an airhead but close. Of course, that could be from being raised as a teenager with all the Hollywood glitz and glamour. As an adult, she's more grounded in the real world. Heath is the one I really feel bad for. Unrequited love is a horrible thing to have to deal with. Maybe we'll see him with his own story in the future.  The story had a natural flow along with some backstory to make you understand why things were happening the way they were. This was another great read from an author who NEVER disappoints! I can't wait for the next one."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Even though I'm giving this four stars, part of me isn't sure I did like it very much - but that's not because Roberto Saviano's brutal and intense story wasn't interesting (via what seems a very good translation). Mostly, it's because of the nihilism of the cocaine industry, and the pointlessness of trying to do much about it. The cartels have all the power, and the money is so huge that of course they will do anything to maintain it - and frankly, banks probably depend on the cash infusions as well.

So what we're left with is a grim, brutal and horrible look at an industry that does infect our lives probably more than we like to admit. But what can we do about it? Not much. And is being educated/informed about it worth reading about it? I'm really not sure. I feel like I generally knew most of what Saviano wrote about so ably, but he certainly rubbed my nose in these gruesome stories. Is that a good thing? And why? I don't know if I have an answer for that!

I respect Saviano going all-in with this story, though, and just having this book out there is important. So even if a reader is turned off by these horrible stories, at least they have been told. So I don't need to like the story - and I think a reader should just respect the story. As long as that's accomplished, the book did its job - it shouldn't be be 'fun and glamorous' and it is not.

Readers of criminal justice will appreciate this - especially fans of true crime accounts (which I'm generally not, I have to say), so it absolutely has an audience. I'm giving it four stars with some general reservations, but with a solid appreciation for the take-no-prisoners account that Saviano has provided. He hammers the topic home, and it takes all the glamour out of the drug, that's for sure."

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Okay, as a reviewer of Sally Bedell Smith's new biography, ""Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of An Improbable Life"", am I judging the book or it's subject? This is a question I ask myself when I review any biography, particularly one of a controversial figure, like a politician or a royal figure, etc. In this case, it's sort of a toss-up; the book is well-written and the subject has gone through his life, making both bad and good decisions. These decisions - based often on whim and fancy - affect a fair number of people, pigs, and plants, and will continue to affect them, after he assumes the throne upon his 91 year old mother's death.

Bedell Smith's bio is just one of many that have been written about Charles over the years, along with the lot on other royal figures, particularly Diana. In the past, these bios have been heavily slanted during the Windsor marriage - Team Charles or Team Diana - but this one is drawn very even handily. The only problem with this book is that if you're a Royal Watcher, you've probably already read parts of this book ten times already under other titles, written by other authors. So, if you're a new reader, I can recommend this book. If you're an old hand at the Royals, you can probably skip it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these shoes for a dual purpose.  I need a good sturdy boot to work around my horse farm.  I also needed a strong shoe that is fit to ride in, so when chores are done, I can just jump on one of my horses without going into the house to change.  In addition, I'm taking a sightseeing trip this summer and will be on my feet at least 12 hours a day.  These boots completely fit the bill.

They are attractive enough that they look great with jeans or khakis.  They look especially cute with white socks and walking shorts.  They are not too clunky, they look like brown sneakers/shoes.  They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period was required.  I stomped through the mud and water and my socks stayed nice and dry.  I worked outside for a good 12 hours, the first time I put them on, and when I got in the house, I felt good, my back, knees and feet felt just fine, all of which I have trouble with.  They are true to size.  I will replace them with another pair when they wear out.  Money well spent.  I recommend them highly.  I'll buy another pair if I find them in black.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me."

This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"As a homeschool Mom I am always looking for new and wonderful ways to teach all of my subjects.
Since I can't just get on a plane and fly all over the world with my children it's nice to have such vivid beautiful pictures to show them of these countries landmarks and tourist attractions.
There isn't a ton of content but what is there is vivid and beautiful and the descriptions are short but apt.
This picture book is set in Italy and deals with the most famous attractions there such as
- Vatican City
- Pompeii
- Venice Canals
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa
- Amalfi Coast
- Lake Como
- Colosseum

I find that this is a good addition to my geography and social studies lessons. For any age. It isn't extremely detailed and it isn't long on pages, but it has great pictures. A great introduction to the important places in Italy.

I recieved this for free or a discount for my honest review."

I felt the author treated the main characters like cardboard cutouts:  there was no real life to them and they acted very stereotypically.  Also, I thought that the plot would jerk forward at times leaving out important details.  Finally, the plot seemed too far-fetched to have happened in the deep south.  Would a plantation owner's daughter really have been a slave runner and married a Native American man?  And after William killed Thomas with an arrow I do not think that he would have remained alive.  Other plantation owners would have hunted him down and killed him in real life, I believe."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"At the very beginning of the book, you get this (way too long) introduction by Randi Fang. Since the name of the character and the writer are the same, at first I thought it was the authors introduction, but it seemed like the story, so I read on. And it's a good thing too, because it was the actual story.

Then after page after page of intro, finally came the interview. But before the interview could get started, there was yet more of the unnecessary yakking, where our interviewee sat at the table texting her heart out while Miss Fang ranted and raved about how attractive this vampire was.

Now the story finally gets started, and it was exactly what I had expected, but it was quick. Of course, we know by this point, the relationship will not advance, so it was no hardship when you never find out what happens next, the interview is simply over.
Then some more dribble about how Miss Fang thinks this Vamp-chick is super hot, and we're done.

I had to order another set for her husband, because he is taller, so I had to go to the store and buy a bigger one for her. She loves it, too.

She will buy another set for her husband, too.These are super cute and the colors are great.  I love the way they are made.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I thought they would be a bit thin for my shower.  But they are thick enough to keep my shower curtain from falling over.  And the fact that they are so small makes them great for my bath.  So far I have not had any problems with them getting wet and getting scratched.  However, I think they are a bit thinner than I thought they would be, and I will be buying more of them as a gift.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.
I was fortunate enough to receive this scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Again I find a well written and I interesting story with good characterizations and geographical descriptions. The author has obviously done his research and then threaded it together in an excellent story.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I like Michael Crichton. A lot. I began a long time ago with the Andromeda Strain and that was a super thriller.

Dragon Teeth is readable, but it is not a stand out and certainly way below the standard that made him one of the most popular author of thrillers.

There are several reasons for this:

1) Crichton is generally excellent in giving you a deep understanding of the issues involved and leaves you enlightened and informed. For example, in Rising Sun he describes exactly how and why the Japanese company's surveillance cameras were superior and why American sleuths could not retrieve relevant images. In Disclosure he describes how the HR department functions and what is involved in cases of allegations of sexual harassment.

Dragon Teeth is supposedly similar with paleontology as the backdrop. I disagree. The background provided is cursory and a fifteen minute read on the topic on Wikipedia will leave you better informed.

2) Crichton is excellent with cliffhangers. Each chapter leaves you waiting to see what happened next. The pace is relentless the climax is tremendous. Dragon Teeth is distinctly ho hum. The descriptions could come from a travel brochure, the characters are not well developed, and there is little to no suspense.

In addition, there are loose ends. I will not say more because this would be a spoiler but one significant character introduced with fanfare leads you to believe that this character plays an important role in the tale. Instead this character then simply vanishes.

3) There are discrepancies which are jarring. For example, he describes the protagonist as having a full, luxuriant mustache. A sentence later he says that he had a clearly visible scar on his upper lip. The two are incompatible. He can have one or the other but not both.

Overall, this is a reasonably good read but not a thriller and nowhere near the standard one would expect from Michael Crichton."

I love the variety of colors this company offers as well. This would be a great option if you were traveling and needed something easy to hide or just take up as little space as possible. This is a very slim style card wallet and still as the internal slot for some cash as well. I like having both options this company offers for that reason. OPTIONS! I can down size if need be like if were were going to an amusement park or zoo, etc I can use this wallet but for everyday shopping the card case is my go to!

He's tall and has a narrow foot, so it's nice to have an extra size in the shoe.  He is 5'10"", so it's really nice to have it in the size he prefers.  The shoe is a little narrow at the toe, but not too big.  It's a nice pair of shoes to have to wear for work or to wear when walking around the house.  It's also a little hard to find in the stores, so if you're looking for something that's really well made, this might be a good choice.  It's a good buy.  He's going to order another pair soon.

Now she has the bounty hunter on her tail!

In short, to hear any volume, at all, I had to set the volume so loud that, for any other device, I would have had noise complaints, from my neighbors.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience.  Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life.  The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!

I think this book has been an excellent investment for me, and I hope it is for many of you too."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I wish there was a 3 1/2 star option.  I am somewhere between this book is ok and liking it.  Andre and Devon are wonderful characters with great chemistry when they are in the throws of passion.  But, on the other side of that Devon starts out strong and fearless then turns to ""Andre"" mush and then fearless again.  It isn't very consistant.  Then there is Andre, who is a super hot French captian, but is just a brute!!!  There are times he is a head strong man ready to dive in and save the day, and other times he is simply a donkey's butt!

The plot is a strong one, untill we get to the island, then it is rushed alittle.  That is when the story becomes ok for me.  The ending ties up all loose ends, but not very engaging.

The other charachters in this book (Minter, for one) are really great.  I was hoping the second book was about him.

So, basically there were somethings I didn't like about the book, but the bulk of the book was good.  There is some love scenes, so beware if you are looking for clean romance.  (They are tasteful as far as passion goes)

It was a free read from Kindle, and even if I had purchased it, I wouldn't have been disapointed."

Not fitting in because of coming from a very strict pastor's family, having to dress in very conservative styles, and on top of that seeing and smelling strange things connected to others around her, are just a few of her problems.
What makes this book different is the interesting thinking of a spiritual realm that I believe is all around us and the battles that take place.

The soles are a bit tighter than I expected. It will be a pain to get them on and off. The shoe is not a very comfortable shoe. I will be returning them.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book was discussed on Amazon's romance forum. There are mixed feelings about this book. Some people just cannot get past the fact that the husband was violent towards his wife. I do not condone, in any way, physical abuse of anyone. This couple has been divorced for several years and he's had time to grow up and accept that he wrecked his marriage.  She left town and her father kept him on as a valuable employee.  Her father died so she  came back to work for his demolition business. The reunification of this couple was very slow because she did not trust him at all. I am not going to give a long-winded story since this one is not a gotcha kind of book. A young couple where the husband is so damaged and so obsessed with her  that he cannot function as a grown-up. One day he blows and hits her. The story is, for the most part, them having to live together because of her father's will. How they managed to resolve the violence issue and learn to love again is what makes this book a very good book. I did give it five stars.  All of he books are intense and very well written."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is the final book in the Trilogy of ""Oryx and Crake"" and ""Year of the Flood"". I believe if you had not read the first 2 novels in the series you would not really enjoy this final book - you would miss so much. Yes, Ms. Atwood does refer back to the other 2 books to explain, but there is just so much to connect to - as much of a feeling of the other 2 books, as just details

This 3rd novel is about the survivors of the waterless flood gathering together for strength against their common enemy,the Painballers. Toby and Zeb have the largest parts in this book. They take the most chances to save the remaining survivors and the Crakers (recombined DNA humanoids). Toby's nightly stories to the Crakers  are full of both sadness and humor  - because the Crakers are so peace-loving that they almost seem like small children.

This is not as action-packed as the other 2 novels - it is a winding down and a closing. I really enjoyed it though - especially Toby's comments and explanations to the Crakers  :)"

The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I finally got to apply this to a new pair of shoes.  Unfortunately, the cap/nozzle had come off in shipping.  I figured no big deal and put it back on.  But once I started spraying this, I ended up with a ton of it just running down the sides of the can.  So yes, my shoes are great, but it's frustrating I lost so much of the material running down the sides while I was spraying it.  Apparently the nozzle couldn't just be put right back on, though I've done it without a problem on other aerosol cans.  Wish I hadn't waited to use it on new shoes as now return period is past."

I would recommend it to anyone who is into music. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how each of the characters came to meet and fall in love with one another. I will definitely be reading the other books in the series. This was a great book. It was written in a very well written style. I will definitely read the next book in the series. This is a great series and I look forward to seeing where the next book comes from. I am always a fan of Julie Kingsolver's writing. I have read all of her books and have never been disappointed. She is a talented writer and this one was no exception.
Books_5,4.0,OR,I enjoyed this book almost as much as the Hannibal Lector series by Thomas Harris.  I was astounded that a new author could push all the right buttons in this psychological thriller. This being the first book in the series I am going to read the next book.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have another cast iron square grill from Calphalon(?) and after comparing the two I gotta say, Lodge is a lot nicer.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Overall fun to use."
Books_5,5.0,CG,This is not a travelogue. The author describes a few moments from her travels in order to share a few stories. The reader will also enjoy the descriptions of the environments of the cities and the people living there. The book was enjoyable. I enjoyed reading it.

Update: Did anyone ask for an update on this throw pillow? Who can know. But I wanted to say that this pillow is so scratchy that it is pretty much unusable and I'm probably going to get rid of it. I am angry at the pillow but in a larger sense I am angry at myself for letting me underestimate my
worth for so long? I don't need a scratchy pillow. I can live many good lives and have no need for the past."

Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,"Generally speaking I'm a big fan of Reynolds. His hard sci-fi opera stuff is incredible (the House of Suns stories? Are you kidding me? AMAZING! Revelation Space? Masterpieces!!). This though was just so dull and derivative with perfunctory sexy sex character interaction and whatever. I honestly just couldn't be brought to care about any of it. I ended up putting it down due to utter indifference.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER. I started reading this immediately after finishing Cixin Liu's Three-Body Problem trilogy and frankly ANYTHING I might have read following those books didn't stand a chance. Liu's three books might be the finest science fiction I have ever read, ever. As such, it's kind of unfair to review something after reading those science fiction masterpieces. So please take this review of Merlin's Beard (sorry, Merlin's Gun or whatever - who cares?) with a big honking grain of salt."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,Enjoyed parts of the book but needs to have better editing and your characters needed better development. Hence the three stars.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed. The main character, Zachary, is a rich man who has been with the military for many years, and is also a military-minded man who feels that he is a part of something larger than himself.  But he is not.  He is a man who is not his father, but is the son of a man who is not his father."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"You can make plans and decide what your path in life will be.  That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.  It is out of those imperfections, or deviations if you will, that life presents us with challenges and triumphs we may have otherwise missed.

Our story follows Sophie as she is about to achieve her life-long desire to become a teacher. She has done everything in her power to put herself through college while supporting her brother and her wheelchair-bound father.  It has taken incredible determination and self-control to achieve this.

When William comes into her life, she recognizes there is something special between them.  Letting this unique attraction grow is both scary and invigorating.  How they recognize this feeling is mutual and growing is the constant undercurrent to our story.

In the end, we walk away knowing life is full of challenges.  A well-planned future has to be adjustable.  We must bend to the unexpected trials we find along our way to our future.  Love is the constant and family sustains us."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This was a great series. Loved the characters and their humor.  And definitely interested in what happens from here.  A great read.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the best books I've read this year. The story is compelling, the characters excellently written, and it deals so very, very well with the intrinsic power imbalance in any relationship involving slavery.

The romance is a slow burn by necessity, but is very much secondary to the storyline until it's really thrown in James' face what he's been doing all this time. Watching him have to re-evaluate everything he's understood in his life and slowly struggle with new insights (and that he might not be as good a man as he's thought) is the real story of the book, despite the high fantasy surrounding it. And it's wonderful, staying compelling without dragging through too much navel-gazing."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The earpieces are great but one of them doesn't work. But apart form that it worked pretty well. The earphone is comfortable and the wiring is okay.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Very nice micro case but could use some improvements, primarily on the hard drive cage.  Overall this case is easy to work with as most parts unscrew and can be removed such as the top and the motherboard tray.  Wiring can be tricky so a modular power supply and shorter SATA cables can pay off here.  Lots of room for your CPU heatsink of choice and a large fan blowing from the front that cools well even at very low RPM's.  The two main complaints I have for this case are the orientation of the hard drive cage which should be rotated 90 and the lack of sound deadening materials in the side panels.  Otherwise this is a great case that is very compact for what it holds and rewards you for your efforts."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I am a professional filmmaker and videographer. I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price. Worth every penny. Only buy NEW (used tape is not reliable) and be sure to buy the FIVE PACKS which offer the best deal for your money."

Possibly this is a spin off from another story or series, as I felt like some of the characters back story was already out there, thus some of the story being glossed over. I would recommend this story to people who like flaws in their characters. Brier and Jackie both have issues, but overall were likeable. I wanted to throttle Bram and we never met Thor, that's why I think there was more to this story. Who knows maybe the author is planning on doing a prequel to this story."

I just put them in the sink and it is nice to be able to feel them out.  I have them on my sink next to my shower door, which is perfect for the small bathroom.  I am really happy with this purchase!

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a soft mattress.  I have two of them in my bathroom and one in a closet.  I was able to find one of them on Amazon for $15 more.  I would definitely recommend this mattress to anyone looking for a soft mattress.Very nice looking.  I have not used it yet but I will update when I do.I have always wanted to own these so I could take pictures of them on my computer.  They are very easy to set up and I can use them on my computer to take pictures of everything.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse. I have no issues with video quality, with the exception of some bumpy Netflix experiences, but that's not a Roku issue.  I have convinced a few of my non-sports viewing friends to get rid of their cable completely and just use Roku.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus are my favorite channels, but I explore the other options every once in a while.  I don't use Pandora only because I don't have decent speakers on my television, but would certainly enjoy it if my sound situation improves.

I love Roku and can't think of a single negative aspect."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I read this book after watching John Carter, the recent Disney movie about the Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars.  There are huge differences between the book and movie, the greatest of which is the representation of Dejah Thor is, who is far more the demure and dependent woman in this original text. I intend to read the sequels soon, so it is likely her character will be more developed and powerful in them. Regardless, this is an entertaining look at science fiction written before the common use of airplanes and well before the public expectation of space travel, and a clever story of one man's journey through danger and death on a foreign world. Burroughs has a distinct writing style in his Tarzan stories and this as well, but his descriptions are excellent and his male characters, at least, are developed and noble."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book is fantastic.  It uses the best training approach, very effective.  It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.  The book is full of not only very specific and well developed training techniques, but it also goes on to give solutions and ideas if a puppy is not learning the desired skill.  I found it extremely practical, far more than other books I bought.  It corresponds and doesn't conflict with the manners and socialization classes we are taking for puppy training.  The progression of skills is very logical, allowing you to train using logical building blocks.  Getting the first series of lessons taught to puppy leads you in a logical sequence to the next chapter.  There is also a great chapter on how to resolve problems such as barking, house training, and all the nusiance behaviors (growling, jumping on your bed, etc).  Easy to read, easy to follow, and I am so happy to have found this book.  Kudos to the author."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Can I please get more?

I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.

Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a character who will say what they feel, and I have been told on many occasions that I need a filter....so I feel as if me and Leslie are one in the same. Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.

Oliver, has scars - both on the outside and inside. That man wound his way into my heart, and I am so grateful that he did.

I cheered for Leslie and Oliver, I cried when I feared things would not end up the way I had hoped, I laughed - a lot.

Susan Mac Nicol has a way with words, and her Men of London are just another reason I want to jump in a plane and plan a trip.......I want to find these guys and hug them all, and never let go. Thank you Susan for writing such a wonderful book, one that will be read over, and over again."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For lack of cliche's I'll say this one is a nailbiter. Imagine being confronted with your certain death, but then given a chance to prolong or relive seven hours of your life. Dan gets this opportunity to beat certain fate and make it up with his presence, and it's a race against time to get what he intended within those seven hours.
Our time on earth is limited. We all die at some point, and Mike Dellosso wakes you up to the fact of this limit of life. Once you grasp that, he paints a story that it's not what's behind you that counts, its about being intentional and forward thinking to the relationships that matter most in each precious moment we are granted here that matters. And once you realize this in the story, the pages turn very quickly as you hope against each obstacle Mike writes to see if Dan can get it done.
Despite your best guessing you won't predict the end, but it will leave you choked up and reconsidering your seven hours left. Even though you don't know when Thomas Constant sets your timer.
Time is ticking...."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Another great, high quality rug I own from Norcho. I love this company! They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her. I will continue to order items from this company in the future! * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion *"

Then the Dauntless attacks a fraction because of a serum that controls their minds. The Dauntless start to kill the other fraction. You will have too read to find out what happens next.

Books_5,5.0,OR,I really enjoyed this historical novel even though much of it had to be purely speculation on the author's part.  Michelle Moran did well in bringing the historical characters to life as she always does.  It was an interesting read with enough true facts to inform the reader about ancient Egypt as well.

The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.

I bought a NEW MOTOROLA charger, and have used it twice now, no issues with the plug and no shorting out.  So I recommend you save yourself my pain, and buy the Motorola OEM Charger (also on Amazon) for $9 vs. the $6.75 that this thing cost."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These rain boots are comfortable and cute. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 in a regular shoe; I bought these in an 8. With socks on, the foot fits well around the arch, ankle, & heel (my mother, who has very high arches, did not find the arch as comfortable). The toe is roomy, but I like that. The ankle feels likes it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoes or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clips on the interior side of the calves are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comments have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your feet slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clips are not so large as to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement.  After all, they're made for stomping around in rain and mud, not to be worn as dress shoes or at runway shows, even though they are cute enough for that. ;)  Overall, I like them and would recommend them."

I don't know what I was waiting for. To find I liked one of the characters? Or hated another?

I picked it up because I thought it was some sort of crime novel and then it turned out to be about people - not my usual bag at all.

But I kept reading. It kept me up a few nights, just waiting for the shoe to drop.

And I realized I did like some of the characters. They were all broken in some way and I kind of warmed to them.

And when the shoe dropped I was pleased. And very happy I'd read it.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I have long been fascinated by the fauna and Flora of Australia. This charmingly illustrated tale of the life cycle of a lonely bandicoot was hard to put down. The author humanized this creature and his encounters with other fauna of the outback. It is clearly a harsh environment and these creatures are threatened by non-native species as well as the droughts, floods and fires of this amazing island. I came away with a greater understanding of the rare desert marsupials."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"A First Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links between Leadrship and Mental Illness is a book you might want to read.  Some will find the historical illustrations thin while others may find the analysis provided a stretch in place, but Nassiar Ghaemi has published one interesting book.  Ghaemi is the director of the Mood Disorder Program at Tuft Medical School.  Using available historical and medical evidence, he argues that various mood disorders can be  linked to success in leadership situations.  In individual sections he takes up creativity, realism, empathy, and resilience.  He finally takes up treatment and mental in general.  Along the way, he illustrates his views using the lives of well known persons including Bush, Blair, Nixon, JFK, Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Lincoln Churchill.  Just the character sketches that Ghaemi uses is worth the price of the book.  This is one of the more thought provoking books that I have read in the past couple of years.  Readers will approach leadership differently after completing this volume."

I don't know why, but my family has a lot of fun with masks and costumes, well past their typical use day and age suggestions. So I knew that we'd have fun with this one. I chose the pug because........... um, it's a pug?!? A pug face on a dog body is cute/funny enough. A pug face on a human body is hysterical.

This mask is rubber and fits a variety of head shapes and hair styles. It does have a funky smell as a lot of rubber masks do, but once it's aired out a bit, it's not even noticeable. The eye holes are actually near the snout, rather than the actual eyes, so it gives it a little more of a realistic look. The only thing I'd change is the mouth opening. If the person wearing it smiles and their teeth show it's super freaky. We're using this as a quick costume when needed, to make funny videos, to wear while riding the bike (why not - it really makes people look twice). Sometimes I wear it in the car (as a passenger, never while driving). Basically, doing anything you can think of that would look funnier if a person with a pug head was doing it.

It's a fun mask, good quality and would definitely fit a variety of sizes. See my photos for an idea of how it fits an adult woman and adult man. I'd actually like to get some of the other critters for variety."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a sweeping family saga set during the Dublin Easter uprising and the First World War. The Carmodys are a well to do Irish family living a charmed life in Dublin. Tragic events following the 1916 Easter uprising sees the family at odds with each other and forced to move to London.
Young firebrand Danny is supporting the cause of an independent Ireland. This puts him at odds with his brother Patrick who decides to join the Royal navy. Jenny his spoiled sister finds herself penniless and forced to look for work. Her Fiance John, once a promising prospect, is arrested for his involvement in the uprising and imprisoned.
This book is meticulously researched and contains many period details that bring the story alive. The working conditions for the women in the munitions factories and the horrors of the battlefield are a brutal back ground that helped me feel a great deal of compassion for the family.
I especially liked the character of Jenny as she undergoes a complete transformation. She starts of as a spoiled and selfish girl, but through hardship her eyes gradually open and we see her grow into a confident, independent and intelligent young woman. The story ends in 1917 and as this is titled book 1, I hope that Ms Petken is already busy writing the follow up. There are turbulent times ahead for Ireland and Im sure well see Danny involved. I look forwards to reading the follow up as this writer has a very engaging style and her research is solid."

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written. There is a lot of sex and love in this book. I would recommend it."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"First of all, you cannot compare ANY books to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it as if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other authors to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either.
With that said, this book tells a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that builds between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read parts of this book and I did get tears in my eyes during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he has for Lisa.
The story begins when Lisa goes back in time, she meets Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story goes on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she knows no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story takes you by suprise. I was not expecting an ending like that, but it was a pleasent ending none the less.
I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys time travel/romance stories. You just CANNOT compare it to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. But Karen Marie Moning does deserve an applaud for this story."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews on this bag, but I was pleasantly surprised with it once it arrived. First of all, this is a very, very large bag. Almost too big for everyday use. It would be a great diaper bag or travel bag. It comes with a removable shoulder strap which is great. It has several pockets, but they're quite large as well. A drop in bag organizer would be great for this. The quality is a little less that I would like. The canvas is very thin and the lining is this as well. I'm not sure how this bag would hold up to everyday use. I checked the stitching on it and it seems pretty sturdy. My favorite thing about this handbag is the color. I got the yellow and blue and I think it's absolutely gorgeous. My only worry about this bag is how well it will hold up over time, but I will update my review if needed. At this point, I would recommend this bag to anyone needing a larger than normal tote. This would definitely have you covered."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Sizing I kept thinking, I'd hate to order these shoes and not have them fit. I read somewhere between 2030 reviews regarding Comfort and sizing. There were a significant number of complaints regarding the sizing of the shoes. 100% of the complaints were about over sizing issues. I normally wear a size 12 wide. But after reading the reviews and of course checking the sizing chart; I came to the conclusion that I would go with A size 11 1/2 m. With standard shipping (free) The shoes arrived in a timely manner. When I popped the shoes out of the box, I found a beautiful brown soft leather shoe. Now, I would not describe the shoe as a hightops or mids and of course they're not flip-flops. But the glove leather that does fit around your foot is just high enough that one would be only marginally wrong in calling them sandals. When I placed the shoes on my feet the length was perfect but the width was a different story. The width of the shoe on my left foot was dead-bang, whereas the right foot felt like it was in a vise grip. There was absolutely no problem with returning them. Called Amazon immediately and I was provided with a digital return label. Drop them in the mail and my account was credited. My only disappointment was that the shoe simply did not fit."

The seams and edging all around this shirt are well sewn and smooth, no seconds here. The v-neck style is actually cut too low for my husband's taste, he said it looks like some of my v-neck t-shirts - as in too feminine for him.

The shirt does run small though and despite not liking the v-neck, he would wear it anyway if it fit right. It's a little narrow in the shoulders for him and fits more like a small. Compared to the medium t-shirts in other brands, this one is cut differently. On the plus side, it fits me fine and the fabric is very soft, but he's right, that v is feminine."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy."

I was unsure if I would benefit from this book. After all, I don't really have any enemies, not in the human form anyway. But i do at times battle addiction, fear, anxiety, depression... would this book help me understand God's purpose for our own internal struggles?

The answer is yes. Anything you face - any person, any struggle, any weakness - may feel like an enemy. But sometimes your enemy is your best opportunity. ALL things work together for good! God may use an enemy to bring about your great purpose & destiny. But it is all worth it in the end!

Life can be hard. It seems like we have barely made it through one battle, when we're facing another. But this book is a great encouragement & testimony to the fact that God is with us & sees us face our enemies. He knows, and it isn't him punishing or being angry with us! He is actually just using these trials to promote us to the next level.

I think this book was well-written. I also liked how it was broken down into short chapters. It made it seem like an easier read that way! Ron Carpenter used personal examples, too, which was very helpful in knowing that He has been through some HARD TIMES as a pastor but that God truly brought him through it!"

They usually are longer and even though I got a size one of thissuper comfy stretch denim five pocket jeans it is still a little big on me especially on the hip and back side maybe because I am not that gifted on that part. The hip is also a bit higher than my usual preference but that is fine since I don't tuck my shirts. I wish that the front pockets are a little deeper. These are the down sides when purchasing clothes online. Even if you got your size there is no guarantee that it fits exactly the same. Others are cut differently and sometimes smaller or bigger on you. I will just have to remedy it since thats what I normally do. Despite that the jeans was well made and the stitches are sturdy.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This short little novel, which spawned two films, one with Robert Donat and the other with Peter O'Toole, was originally a story Hilton wrote in November of 1933 for the Christmas issue of the British Weekly. It found its way across the pond to the U.S. and the Atlantic Monthly and became a smash hit. It was repackaged as a novel and went on to great reviews and big sales. The story revolves around an 80-ish man, Charles Edward Chipping or Mr. Chips, nearing the end of his life and his recollections of his times, tribulations and triumphs at the Brookfield all boys prep school in England, from before the turn of the century to the 1930s. It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI. Sweet, charming, inoffensive and ultimately slight and forgettable. If you want something meatier and more substantive from Hilton, try ""Lost Horizon,"" a terrific tale of Shangri-La.

I say this as someone who has published for West Point on the subject of warlords. Paolo has the dynamics of the soldier boys down. I kept wondering, ""Did this guy live it?"" which is about as good a compliment as one can give an author.

His creatures are very good. There are coywolves, also called red wolves. That bounced me out of the story a bit, but then I realized that he connected me into the world that way. The genetically engineered creature named Tool was interesting. I found myself wondering how to make him, and realizing that he could be made, one at a time as a chimera, through surgery in utero. Which was a bit of a brrr, moment. The conditioning though, that would be harder.

It's good sci-fi, but it's more than just a story. It gives an opportunity for Americans to feel what it's like to be caught up in such madness. The madness exists today - even now.

The one thing I would have liked though, is for the Drowned Cities to run piracy operations like is done off the coast of Somalia. (It won't surprise me if Libya starts doing it too, but inside the Mediterranean it can't be ignored as much as Somali.) That's a tiny miss to his economy of the cities.

By the way, the Zulus - on theory about this tribe is that they descended from a lost Roman garrison on the southern end of the empire after Rome disintegrated. The garrison became a tribe with roots in military traditions, much like the depiction of the warlord armies of the Drowned Cities."

Books_5,2.0,CG,"As SENSE & SENSIBILITY (S&S) is an easy read, and I highly recommend it for everyone!

I read this book in the fall of 1999, when I was a student in college. I was a little skeptical of the value of this book. I was interested in the possibilities of the book, but I was also concerned that it would be marketed as a book for the general public. I was quite surprised to see that the author had written a book with a title like ""The Secrets of Your Life"" which is the subtitle. I felt that it was a little too general in a way that it was not. I think it was a good read.

I did not like the cover of this book. I thought the title of the book was too general and I had no idea what the title meant. It was very misleading. I think the book was very well written and had a very well-developed story. I think it is a good read for the general public.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I've heard a lot about Alisha Rai but I've never actually read any of her work before PLAY WITH ME. Whoo, now I'm starting to think I should correct that...because this book is hot!

Tatiana and Wyatt were teenage lovers. Then they had a bad split. Now, Tatiana is about to contact Wyatt again for the first time in years because, by striking coincidence, it turns out that her biological brother (with whom she recently met for the first time) has gotten in trouble for stealing from Wyatt's casino and he and his young family can't afford the consequences if Wyatt presses charges. Tatiana is hoping to plead her brother's case.

Typed out like that, it kind of sounds like the set-up to some bad porn. Which, technically, I guess it is. PLAY WITH ME is an erotic short, clocking in at just over 100 pages, and about 85% of those pages consist of sex scenes, or build-ups to sex scenes.

But PLAY WITH ME is a cut above most erotica I've read. The characters are well written, with real flaws and insecurities. Their emotions are conceivably realistic. The dirty talk is good. The scenarios are well written, consensual, erotic, and somewhat inventive. Both the hero and heroine get off, and have open communication with one another about what they want and what their expectations are.

"
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I liked it. I didn't love it.

After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There was an entertaining main character, lots of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem was that I didn't connect with the main character.

Harry was so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what was inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry.

On a couple of occasions in the book, Harry claims to struggle with his choices. He wants to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draws him toward darker things. I know about these struggles because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much as a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation was lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy.

Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away. I will read the second book in this series though, and I hope to see Harry making some tough decisions that show me the darkness he claims is inside him."

 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.

Since I am from Kansas, I usually read books with Kansas as the location since most authors do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about.  This is an incredibly good book.  I loved this.  It starts in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl.  Daddy calls all the shots in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son.  He bought their house, gives Jem an allowance, hires their help, everything.  When her father gets caught with his hands in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move.  Seth decides they are going to Kansas.  He actually winds up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line.  They move and start a new life.  One that Seth thinks he will control and start to call the shots.  God has other plans.

Jem is a wonderful fictional character.  She is soooo dramatic and funny.  She cracks me up even when she is being horrible.  Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman.  Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you.  The only thing I did not like was the format.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,CG,I bought these boots because I have a wide foot and I need a lot of support.  They do run small but I am a size 10 and the fit is perfect.  The only thing I would change is that the boots are a little loose around the toes.  The shoe is a
Books_5,1.0,CG,I've read a lot of books by the author and this one is by far my favorite.  The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the author is very clear that it's a little different in the way she chooses to deal with her own issues.  The book is a bit slow at times and it's a bit hard to follow at times as you're trying to figure out who the main character is and who they are.  It's very refreshing to have a book that is written in the style of a book that is written with a great feel for a story.  I especially like the way the author describes the characters and the theme of the story.  I really liked the way the author gave us an idea of who the main character was and what her feelings were about the world.  I really liked the way she took the reader

Books_5,4.0,CG,"A remarkable construction, starting at the top, with the third chapter, which is a very interesting one.

I had to read the first two chapters to understand the significance of the other two chapters.

The second chapter is a bit different. I was interested to see how the authors were going to develop their characters and how they would write about the lives of the people involved in the events.

I felt like I was reading a story about an old woman who had her own problems with her boyfriend, who was basically a serial killer, who had gotten into a bad relationship with a guy she knew nothing about, who was trying to get revenge on her boyfriend.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product."

But this top will- I would recommened buying TWO sizes up to account for shrinkage.  I had to give them away because after drying they no longer fit in the armholes- too tight.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,CG,"I have a small blender that has a wide range of functions, and this is the first one I've used.  The motor is easy to use, and the motor is very quiet.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the blades with a single hand.  I just have to pull the blades away from the blade, and it will eventually melt.  The blades have a nice twist-able handle.  I love that they are made of glass.  I will be purchasing more of these.  The blades are very sharp, and the blade spring is very firm.  I love that the blades are made of glass.  I like that they have a clear plastic backing.  I have also purchased the metal blades for my next blender.  I love the fact that the blades have a very soft edge.  I use these to slice a lot of vegetables and salads.  I love the fact that they are made of glass.  I love that the blades have a very soft feel to them.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  I also love the fact that they have a nice, smooth feel to them.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend these blades.I bought this to protect my coffee cup from frosting and baking.  The cup is sturdy and a great value.  I have tried several other types of coffee makers but never had any issues with it.  I have used the same cup for almost all the types of coffee I have used and the coffee still tastes great.  I am very happy with this product."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

For me, Riding It was an easy read. I didn't need to read the full length story. It was a little slow to get into the story. I wanted to go through it in one sitting.

He has a medium chest, but it's not as long as a large. We had to go up a size because the waistband is very short. I ordered the medium because I normally wear a small and it fits well.

Stefano Ferraro is a ruthless alpha who is in charge of his family business, some legal and some not so much. Stefano is the utimate alpha who claims his mate as soon as he finds her and will do anything to protect her.  Francesca Cappello is my favorite type of heroine, she is caring, giving, fiesty and doesn't let the hero run over her.  Their attraction and chemistry jumps off the pages, their emotions beautifully written, I fell in love with both of them.

I have a strong feeling that the mystery, intrigue, emotions and off the charts chemistry along with the incredible world-building the Shadow series will catapult this series to my favorite of Ms. Feehan's series.

Give Shadow Rider a chance, even if you don't care for paranormal, it's a book not to miss!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people."

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them.

They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth.

Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Have you read this series? If no, start now! If yes, buy Hard Eight ASAP; fun reading lies ahead! Unlike Grafton's ""alphabet series"" which is getting formulaic and almost boring, Evanovich continues her ""number series"" at her high standard. Stephanie Plum continues to be a vitally inept bounty hunter. In this one she loses four (or is it five?) sets of handcuffs. She needs help bringing in one of her targets as he suffers from poor equilibrium: she cuffs him, he falls over, he's too fat to right himself--believe me, its laugh-out-loud funny. And, of course, Grandma Mazur continues her two favorite activities: ogling every man under seventy and haunting wakes to checkout the mortician's handiwork. Stephanie continues to be conflicted about her two men: the mysterious Ranger and cop Joe Moretti. Her stout heart and indefatigable manner finally pay off--you know they will--and the good guys triumph. Evanovich is a master of presenting a time and place: the Burg in New Jersey. Her humor is rampant and her characters are winning. Like I said: start or continue this series."

Books_5,5.0,CG,So I've been reading this book for the last two years and it's always a pleasure to read. I had a friend who was a social worker and she had a lot of fun reading this book. It was a very interesting story about the lives of people living in the south. It was a great read. I read it several times over the course of a month and it made me want to get back to it. I'm looking forward to getting back to it. I have read all of her books and the series has been really good. I was actually not sure if this was a good book but it definitely was. I read this book first to get the idea of the book and now to get to the actual content. I can tell you I was a little worried that this book would be the last book in the series but I was glad I didn't. It was really well written and really kept you guessing as to who was who. I really enjoyed the interaction between the main characters and their personalities. I loved the idea that they were so different that it was possible for them to be very different and that I would like them to be together. I was really hoping that the story would have been longer and I think that is the case and I am glad that I did. I was also hoping that there would be more depth to the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm happy I read it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed this book. It is a very good read and I have read the entire series.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"McIntyre sets out from California to see if he can get all the way across the country without touching money, relying only on average Americans for shelter and food. It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

Funny at times and heartbreaking at others, this was a well written and fascinating story."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"The story was absoulutly horrible and on a rating from one to ten, it would be a negative five.  It would not be worth a cent, to even a book deprived orphan.
  For starters, it has no plot, whatsoever.  The closet thing to a plot that can be found, if you have the time and patience to look, it that, if your a mermaid, don't be annoying.
  For the mermaid in the story is beyond annoying.  She gets to the point that you just want to wring her scaly neck.  She talks back, is stubburn and rude.  And yet the two main characters in the story LIKE her!
  The story starts with these two incredibally boring girls who (fortunatly) are moving away from each other, soo.  I don't know if I could stand another sentance of ""I'll miss her so much"" or ""I wish I could go back in time.""  They the spoiled mermaid and set her up with this nice guy, who, incrediable, likes her.  It would be more likly that he would be struck by lightning, than to the find and like this mermaid.
  But all bad things can't last for forever, much to my pleasure, and the mermaid goes back to the sea, before dieing from lack of salt (booo!!!).  Then, in the end, the guy must turn into a fish, or something, because he goes out to live witht he mermaid.  They should have just had the mermaid into a fish fillet.

First three chapters of the book are on hikikomori, which are also used to describe the book as a whole, but these chapters have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. It is like two separate books in one.

This is an economic and cultural analysis of  the declining Japanese economy supported by statistics and the author's own views. It also draws stark comparison with South Korea. I had no idea there were such fundamental differences in their economies and people."

Footsteps stomped with the force of a giant on the wooden steps. Pounding in synchronization with each ragged inhale Nikki took.
Dang it. The door. Just as she lunged forward to lock it, the handle turned. She jumped back. This is probably nothing, just an innocent mix up in dates. But then again She lifted the spoon over her head.
A broad shoulder, covered in dark blue, entered her line of vision. Then a crop of longish, wavy hair. Just as the man angled his back to the door to close it
Womp! Not one to sport violent tendencies, she lowered the spoon with all the force of a pillow fight.
Owe! What the!
Startled blue eyes rounded on her. Apples and oranges skipped off the top of the brown paper sack and went flying across the floor. Shock, pain and aggravation crossed the mans features. His strong jaw clenched as if he fought against retaliation and she supposed, a string of cuss words.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent book. Funny, insightful. Puts a modern day angle to the age old questions of good vs. evil. Another great work from two of our best fiction authors."
Books_5,5.0,CG,An excellent read of one of the best detective novels in recent history.  The characters are well developed and well developed.  I look forward to the next book in the series.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little slow going.  I liked the setting
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This six foot cable is reasonably priced and well designed. The lightning connector end over-rmold is hardier than the apple cable, as it has both a textured feel and is wider at the back allowing a better grip for its removal. If you have ever pulled on the smooth/shinny perfectly straight Apple lightning cable you know what I mean!!!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Vivian Rose Lee has done it again.  This book will keep you captive from start to finish. This book is a story that you can envision happen in real life. The love in the story will win your heart. Great story great book.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Bought this to use in a commercial kitchen for hard to clean dishes. All employees used it when cleaning dishes and it got job done. Its durable as it wound up in garbage disposal a couple of times and was still usable. A two pack supply was nice for the money.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"My daughter loved this book between the ages of 12-14 months.  She loved to make the sounds of each animal when she opened the flaps and found out what they were.  Now shes 16 months old, shes moved on to books with a little more storylines but she still goes back to this book from time to time and still enjoys telling me what each animal is and what they say."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"Got the black/ dk. Gray and it's just as comfortable.

The only reason I ordered the black is because the color is a bit darker than the picture"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This is a great value for 150. I was surprised by the quality  of the build of this stand very well built .
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this to replace an ancient netgear router. I should have replaced it a long time ago! This is a huge upgrade. It was easy to set up and between the 2g and 5g bands, we are getting a strong signal in all parts of the house. The wifi is faster and more reliable than ever. My only gripe is that the router itself is kind of a beast and has to sit out in the open, instead of tucking away. But at least it is sleek looking."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"It is official: vampires are so last year. Kate's Fallen helps lead the way in this new angelic revolution. Novels such as Fallen will easily do for angels what the Twilight series did for vampires.

Fallen was almost exactly what I was hoping it would be. It was dark, romance, and had tons of unexpected plot twists that had me gasping. While there is some room for improvement with the pacing of the novel, the overall premise was amazingly creative. It features a wonderful blend of religious ideals with Kate's fictitious world. Kate has a wonderful way of pulling the reader into the world of Sword & Cross. I constantly found myself thinking I had only read about five pages, only to discover it was closer to twenty. This is due in part to how well Kate explores the world she has created. Every detail has been thought of, and is explained beautifully.

But by far, my favorite aspect has to be the characters. Luce is an interesting heroine. I am really interested to see how she develops since there is a lot of potential with her. And I can't wait to see more of her and Daniel. They are an interesting pair to say the least. While I love those two, it is Cam that really has my attention. He is an alluring mixture of good and evil. I am dying to learn more about him, and his overall role in the plot. In regards to secondary characters, Kate has created some of my favorites of all time, with Penn leading the way. They are funny, creative, and above all else, memorable.

Despite certain plot issues that need to be addresses, I have to say that I am pleased with this novel. It was highly creative, and left me wanting to know me. I can't wait to see what twists await me in the next book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Great story with characters who stay consistent, yet grow throughout the series. Fun magical adventures in a well-written story capture the imagination."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,I loved the story. Ryan and Juliette are very close. The story was a bit different.
Books_5,5.0,CG,I have been following this series for the last two years.  I have read the first one and am so glad I did.  I have also read the second one.  This is a very well written book.  I am very excited for the third one to be released.  I am looking forward to the third book.I had to wait a year for this book to get published.  This book is a must read for any young adult.  I would recommend it to anyone who is into young adult fiction.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,A good story to fall back on and enjoy. I will definitely be reading the next one.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Using 1/3 cup to feed my Chihuahuas and the rest to help me with portion control.  Overall, great items for the price."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Perfect for pendants to be worn at a longer length and on a lovely chain.  I couldn't be more satisfied.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"'Very' complicated, to say the least. Don't know that this is something to attempt for he faint of heart :) Interesting way to have the MCs interact, and I wavered between liking it and not liking it. Much thought went into how this would work with a pseudo-parental relationship, and what is left of the family dynamics. When it was done, I found I enjoyed the story, and am glad everyone came out with their needs and life-dreams somewhat addressed."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"You'd be better off working through Competitive Strategy by Michael Porter, there's nothing in here that isn't in Porter's book. This books is a little easier to read for the casual reader however and does have more examples to explain the topics."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,CG,Love my cargo shorts.  They fit well and look good too.  I have a wide foot and a wide foot.  I am a 32D
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I read the short story version of this book right after I finished ""The Blood & Bone Trilogy. I don't remember if I left a review but I do know I gave it 3 ***'s. What I do remember was how robbed/cheated I felt because the short story should have been so much  more.

I can't really explain how exited & pleased I was at received an email from the Author saying she changed her mind about Suicide "", the original title and making it into a three part trilogy. Let's just leave it at there may have been some singing, The Happy, Happy, Joy
Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance.
This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :)  The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!!  She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go.  Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunks of world &/or character  building.

I absolutely cannot wait for the next two booka."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a book for dreamers, lovers and the mommas boy in all of us. I lived at home until I was a vine-ripened 27, so believe me I can relate to James Thurbers Mitty. And Ive always been a fond of a good daydream. Lets see what comes to me now:

Im a powerful land baron with an eye patch. Nay, a feudal samurai lord. No, Im an oil tycoon. Fabulously rich, silver-haired, steely-eyed and whats this? Im in turbulent fight with my lover, no my sister, no my lover and her vengeful son. He has gun. So do I! This tension is terrifying. Daydream continued in the next paragraph.

Where was I? Ah yes, the daydream. Now, Im a young man. A prospector trying to hit it rich. Do I? Yes! This is my daydream, of course Ill hit it rich. Black gold. The farm is saved. I am more lost in this daydream than any I have ever had. Its spellbinding. Its tear-jerking. Spine-tingling. There are plots upon plots upon plots. It twists, it turns. Its a veritable roller coaster ride of goddamn emotion. This is by far the most powerful daydream Ive ever experienced. It feels like an eternity, yet no time has passed. I am exhausted.

And now, I have a confession to make. That was no daydream. That was me experiencing in both words and pharmaceutical hallucinations, the broad plot of my dramatic novel The Spoils of Babylon, set to air on IFC, this very January the 9th, 2014. Adapted, directed, casted and colored in full Breath-Take-o-Scope by yours truly. I do apologize for my surreptitious diatribe, but I must admit, I can scarcely contain my excitement. After more than 40 years and literally thousands of edits (two editors died), the hour is upon us. And it shall be no mere daydream.

Oh, and read The Secret Life of Walter Mitty sometime, its a delight.

Finest regards,

Eric Jonrosh, author, The Soils of Babylon, airing on IFC, January 9th, 2014"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The cover art of headless viewers watching television says it all. My only brush with the late Neil Postman came when he spoke at the university I was attending in the northwest. A breezy east coaster, he was unaware of the need to step on eggs. During the questions, one woman said, ""Mr. Postman, how can we help children have self-esteem?"" to which he replied, ""I don't want them to have self-esteem; I want them to esteem something other than themselves.""

After the stunned silence I and a few others rose and started clapping; it was very much as if life had been returned to Pepperland in Yellow Submarine. I've been clapping inwardly ever since, as when I read this book.

There are hundreds of reviews of this book, which created a stir everywhere. Everyone (except the people running TV) seems to have read it. Most readers find it smooth going. However, those who don't want to tackle the book can still wrestle with the ideas. In Postman's essay collection, Conscientious Objections, he replies to the question ""Why are books so long?"" with the answer that they don't have to be, and as an example gives a short version of this book.

The basic thesis is that along with George Orwell's 1984 in which civilization lapses into a dystopia (opposite of a utopia) ruled by oppression and violence, there was the opposite vision in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that society would be destroyed by indulgence in pleasure. Postman says that while you can make a good case for the first view, the second is in full swing. Now if only the desperate networks would read this book and (re)turn to making good TV."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a tour de force. Davies stands the  Anglo-Franco-centric stance of most Western historians on its head. He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big  threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance  of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this  book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Crimson Eve, the 3rd book in Brandilyn Collins' Kanner Lake series, has been in my TBR stack for quite some time.  I read Violet Dawn (nicknamed Violent Dawn by my book club) and Amber Morn quite a while ago, but was not lost when I started this novel.  Really, they could probably be read as stand-alones, but I like to begin at the beginning.  The novel starts out running and really never quits.  Carla Radling is targeted by a hit man and is unsure just why someone wants her dead.  She literally stumbles into safety, but on the run, she can never be sure who to trust.  The story unfolds through present day action and the diary entries from Carla's 16 year old diary.  The switch between the two really works and the reader is not confused thanks to date entries at the top of chapters and a different font for the diary.  Crimson Eve is a good, quick read if you are looking for page turning suspense."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I really want to give this watch 5 stars, this watch is excellent, high quality, accurate, and great looking, but it loses a star for the weight. Don't get me wrong though i understand all types of these watches are going to be heavy when compared to my g shocks. Wearing the watch daily is not very comfortable, it is a bit heavy and can get sweaty during the summer which is normal, but after weaing my casio g shock which cost $150. I really appreciated the lightweight and comfort of the affordable g shock watch. The seiko is indeed a classy watch but the downside is that is it heavier than my g shock which i end up choosing to wear daily.

This is a great watch for going out and relaxing, but for sports, work, daily tasks, the g shock is my goto watch since its lighter weight and more comfortable with its resin band.

It is hard to make a steel watch very comfortable compared to a resin watch. Otherwise everything else is perfection..Seiko is one of my favorite brand of watches, I would say my top favorite, then Casio, but realistically my daily wear is a casio g shock. If you type of watch is the classy look, then seiko is the best. It's kinetic technology is my favorite, i love how it adjust back to the correct time after i wake it up by a few shakes. It is amazing how accurate this watch is, I set the time and date once, and have had this watch for 4 years and not once did i ever need to readjust the time or date, it has been accurate this whole time.  this watch is excellence, but i deduct one star because I feel its a bit heavy as it should be but just not my cup of tea for a daily wear since I have a lightweight casio g shock as my option."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!"

But real love can help to accomplish sometimes the impossible."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Wow, this is one very intense read! I was so blown away by the emotional pull in this book. I have read other books that Alice has co-authored with and have always loved her work. I have to say I think she outdid herself on this one. So many times I didn't know if I wanted to laugh, cry or just slam the book down and run. When you meet Saga she is just skimming by. Shes worried about making rent and having food to eat. Doing her best to hold on to a job that is not enough to get ahead. When she is at her lowest point, so she thinks things went south in a hurry. When there is no other option she takes a job as an escort. This is where she comes to know Jackson Stone. He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for. Saga is strong, but like all women she has a breaking point and Jackson seems to find just the right buttons to push to break her when he feels like she is getting too close. These two draw you in and keep you wanting more. Im looking and hoping for more from these two."

The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white?

If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"So I ordered without really paying attention to details. Keep in mind that although the some people say it rolls, it really depends on how you apply it! I'm 5'5 147lbs. I'm not chubs, slimmer side BUT with a tummy apparently..I wish it was gone but oh well. Now I got a medium..the torso part goes all the way to my under boobs. I haven't tried making it go higher. But I can say my thighs and stomach feel tighter. It also lifts your butt, which is a plus! Give it a try. You can't tell you're wearing it and it doesn't cause pain when breathing.

Cons: it's tight, not as tight from the stomach as I would like. I did read some reviewers left this comment as well. It doesn't hurt from the torso as others do. The glue type of plastic in the back line helps it adhere to your skin so it doesn't roll.

Pros: I thought the material would be thicker. But nope, they feel like nylons! A bit tighter than nylons. Be careful when pulling it, you can rip it. I haven't ripped mine so we're good.

I am a singer and play several instruments, so I recognize good sound when I hear it. The sound of this speaker can be best described by the title of my review. The quality of the sound cannot be distorted even at extremely high volumes. If, after you buy this speaker, you do not have GREAT sound, it means that you do not have a good enough audio receiver.

If you have a larger head (or smaller body) you may want to get the TRS-80A. The TRS-80A is a great head for those who want to use a large head for the web. The TRS-80A has a very low profile and is very light weight. The TRS-80A has a nice feel to it. I like that the TRS-80A is adjustable so it can be adjusted. You can also adjust the tvs up to 6"" and the tvs down to 5""."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application."

It does not fit over my soaking tub and isn't adjustable, but fits in my standard tub in my guest bath. It gives the guest bath a spa-type feel.

The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her. Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart, a relationship that ended in a disaster. The last thing she needs was to become star struck.

Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet. They had this crazy connection together, but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle, Greg can be pretty much fickle minded. He can be all in, and then all of a sudden, he was nowhere in sight. He can be interested now, and then appear disinterested the next time. He had some secrets of his own, that I wanted to know. I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV. But I was stuck with Cathy, and her thoughts weren't that bad. There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after  and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work

There were times when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg  just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal  they were a great bunch, and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls. Greg was hard to love, but you couldn't resist his charms, so please don't blame Cathy.

I did like the excerpts of the ""Holly Rollers"", her children novel's.  There were parts that were funny, but most the time I thought it was just trying to hard.

Mia and her friends were downright hilarious and the running commentary that Mia kept having in her head had me laughing out loud. West and his filthy delicious mouth was the type of alpha male that every woman dreams of. He let's you know what he wants when he wants it and is very confident in his abilities (with good reason).  Mia didn't think for one second that a casual hook-up with West would result into anything but the pleasure that he gave her. West was thinking the same but come to find out neither one could get the other off of their mind. When Mia finds out that she is now working for him she decides that it will be just business, too bad her heart, mind and panties didn't get the memo.

I'm not sure how much of a improvement they can make but I don't think they should.  They sound great and I'm pleased with the sound.  If I had to guess, I'd say the sound quality is decent.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because they are very small, but I'd be happy with them if they were small enough.

I'm not sure if the speaker is that bad because it's only about 10"" wide.  The reason I give this 5 stars is because I don't like the way the sound is wired.  I was able to find some cable that worked for the price but I never heard of it.  If I had known that I could just buy a different cable that worked, I'd probably buy a different set of speakers.

UPDATE:  I contacted the seller to see if they would send me a replacement pair of speakers.  They told me that they would not and I was able to order one of these.  I was able to send them a replacement pair of speakers but I still have a problem.

The speakers sound great and I'm happy with the sound.  The only downside is that I don't like the way the bass is wired."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Very interesting story line.  Ending left a lot to be desired, other wise enjoyable reading."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Extremely well packaged. Very thick outside box, then another inside box, thick cardboard protection top and bottom. On the small side but I knew that. Step for lid works very well and does not tip even when empty. Soft closing lid is nice also. Must use the plastic liner as the bottom is not solid but that is no issue for me since I wanted something that would not rust from my empty, but wet, contact lens packs. Update:  Been several months now and although it sounds foolish, this is one of my favorite items ever purchased on Amazon. The plastic liner is very simple to remove and dump and clean if needed. I do not feel a need to use a plastic bag. The lid opens and closes softly and smoothly each and every time. No need to keep your foot on the pedal to lower the lid."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Pros. 1. Feels like 'quality'. has some heft to it. gives you a warm, fuzzy when you first take it out of the box. 2. Lots of accessories. everything you need to get started vice a  SD card is in the box. including a short HDMI cable. Cons. 1. Terrible video quality. just terrible. grainy  and washed out. you will not be able to read a license plate of a car parked just in front and to the left or right of you. 2. Operation is not intuitive. crazyest sequence of button pushes I've ever experienced. the 'OK' button is not always 'Ok'. button pushing is on par with entering a cheat code in a video game console. I. e. UP, DOWN, MODE, UP, OK, MENU, MODE , UP, DOWN, UP, UP. argghh. 3. Freezes constantly. tape a paper clip to the side of it as your going to need to reset it constantly. 4. Received a used or open box unit. everything was there, but there were fingerprints all over the lense, the instruction manual was all bent to crap,  the protective film and zip lock bags the originally held the pieces where all at the bottom of the box. This was returned (and would have been anyway since it was pre-owned/used). I have ordered a main-stream GARMIN to take its place."

In his first published novel, John Gorman, a young British soldier from the early days of the war, is forced to flee to France to escape the Nazi occupation.  When he is rescued, he is told he is a spy for the Gestapo and is on his way to a Nazi concentration camp.  The story is told from a very different point of view, which is why I recommend it.  The book is a delightful read, and I especially enjoy the characters.  The book is filled with references to other books and to a few other writers.  I can't recommend it enough.  I was very impressed by the writing style of the author.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.  I was expecting a bit of romance but that didn't happen.  I wanted to love the book and would recommend it to others.Great book.  A great story that was very well told.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"These pillows were no better than the cheap $5 pillows you can find at any low-rent discount bricks-and-mortar store.  Since the Dream Supreme pillow set cost far more than $5, I am extremely disappointed, and I've initiated a return and refund request with Amazon.

There is absolutely no neck or head support - those cheap pillows they give you on airplanes provide more support than these alleged Dream Supreme pillows. I woke up with a hideous neck-ache, which is not something I've ever experienced before.  Don't waste a dime of your hard-earned money buying these cheap junk pillows with a fancy expensive-sounding alias.  They're j-u-n-k.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third person, sometimes I found it a little confusing. Okay, I admit it, I'm not a young man anymore and maybe my short term memory isn't what it used to be.....  :) Erickson began each chapter with the name of the character telling it, so I guess the confusion wasn't the author's fault.

Anyway, I often like romance stories where opposites are attracted to each other. Jay and Quinn are very different but alike in many ways too. The plot contains a fair share of tension but I likes how the guys dealt with it.

Out of Frame was proofed well, and the Kindle formatting was very good on my iPad. This book is definitely on my 'recommend' list for those who like this genre!"

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first Nicholas Spark novel I have read.  I've seen the movie version of ""The Notebook"" (one of my favorite movies) and ""Nights in Rodanthe"", which I enjoyed.  I saw this book selling for fifty cents at a used book store and figured I'd give it a try, as usually the book is better than the movie.

I was surprised at how quickly I read through this book. I haven't read a fiction book in a long time and found myself inspired to pick it up two nights in a row.  I probably finished it in about 4 or 5 hours.

Even though it wasn't all that deep, I really enjoyed it. And though I knew the ending before I even picked up the book, tears flowed freely at the end (I did however, like the ending of the movie better.  The scene where she sits waiting for him after cooking an amazing meal was so sad and I was really surprised at the ending.)

I liked it enough that I want to read more of Spark's novels.  I am definitely going to read another one very soon."

Quick read - alternating points of view
Let me start off by saying the story itself was ok. There were a few errors that were distracting/confusing. The reason why Robyn was kicked out at age 15. The whole family dynamics was off. There story in the beginning of the book was not what was revealed at the end. the relationship between Garrick and Robyn pretty much happened over night. Robyn was very independent and she worked hard to pay her bills and finance her degree. Garrick wanted to take care and protect her. He was possessive and bossy. They clashed a lot. But the make ups were hot and sexy.
There was a lot of drama in a short period of time. Robyn became a magnet for trouble. Near rapes, stalkerish ex, drug dealers etc. Everything wrapped up nice and neat in the end."

From The Book: A Novel by Diana Adams

Author: Diana Adams

Publisher: T&E

I enjoyed this book.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over 50 years.  As they are getting older and having to deal with the past, they are facing a new life together.  They are both young women who are very interested in each other.  They are both going through a difficult time, but they are also going through a very difficult time.  They are both trying to make it through the time together.  The story was very well written and the characters were well developed.  I think the main reason I give it 5 stars was because it was a very good story.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Devon & Georgina (Gina) are a remarkable couple. She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.

Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him. Their back and forth romance is fraught with both tension and delight, and is thoroughly satisfying.

Despite a couple of minor question marks (like not signing the marriage agreement before the wedding), this is a thoroughly enjoyable read."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,CG,Not what I am accustomed to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can
Books_5,4.0,CG,"Like any post-apocalyptic novel, you're bound to find an interesting and engrossing world. I'm not saying that this book is a bad one.  The characters are well developed, and the setting is well"
Books_5,5.0,OR,The author transports you right to the streets of Savannah. The characters are delightfully complex and the story grips you from start to finish.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,CG,These recipes are so easy and easy to follow and you will be able to make the whole recipe. I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I enjoyed this book.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

Bring on the next enstallment!"
Electronics_5,2.0,CG,"Already had to replace one of the original ones because they were all dead, and the other one was a little too old to fit"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"For us men with big fingers, hitting the keys on the tiny keypad on my iPhone is a huge challenge.  Also, I'm 56 and never learned to ""thumb type"".  Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

It is VERY, VERY light.  It is is compact, as you can see from my pic, but still MUCH easier than the native iOS keyboard.  Plus the keyboard has a bunch of cool special features.  Why do I find out about great products like this so late?  I could have used this 5 years ago."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,This is one of 3 pair of Toms I've purchased in the past 2 years.  They are so comfortable and comfortable.  I have bought the Toms in a pair of black and white and they are still good quality.  I wish I had gotten the two in black and white.  I have a wide foot and I can wear the white pair without shoes.  They are very comfortable.  I wear them all the time and they are a perfect size for me.  I have had them for a couple of years and they are comfortable.  They are a little too
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,Great and easy to use. I love the feel of the lens. The zoom is awesome. If you want to get a DSLR with the full zoom you can get it with the 16-55mm.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Addendum review.  I love this cart, right size, versatile, sturdy and mobile (have my KitchenAid mixer on top).  However, the hard plastic casters are scarring my oak hardwood floor. I have been online for hours trying to find a better replacement caster = 1/4-20 x 1"" threaded stem with SOFT rubber wheel.  Can not find all specs in one caster.  Frustrated and disappointed. Still looking...

May have found replacement casters.  Hope so."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,I bought this for a small house and it's just what I needed for my small home. It is so small that it's not worth the extra money. This is great for storing rice or pasta. It's not heavy so it stays cold

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I like dot patterns and this is a nice utility pack. It opens to 2 major compartments with 2 other zip pockets ( one internal and one external, on top). The zip on lunch bag is a great idea for those of us who look like Hannibal crossing the Alps when we go to work. The lunch bag is big enough for a cold pack and my modest lunch. It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use. I think it would be perfect for older school kids and simplify their morning routine. The colors of my pack are significantly different than the photo of the dot pattern."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Ferrigno has a perfect summer read here. It has action, good dialogue, off center characters and reads very fast. I would like to see Val back in  another book or two. I like a hero who is extremely tough and can hold his  own against anyone yet still has a moral code and can still fall in love."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"Great story, very fun. I recommend it. I really enjoyed this book. It is a short story. It is not the best I have read in a while. It was a very good read. I had no idea that this book would be about the dogs and how they lived. I love a book about a dog and it will make you laugh and cry. I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"When I was a child, I devoured Isaac Asimov's books -- especially his Robot and Foundation books, which he ended up combining near the end of his life. As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"No one includes a better mix of action, adventure, romance, and humor in one story than Patti Larsen and this installment of the Blood & Gold series is no different. I love Larsen's writing and characters and how easy it is to become immersed in the world(s) of her imagination. I not only recommend this book and series but anything written by her."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Works well enough for what I use it for (as a test server). I'm tempted to get something else similar, perhaps a NUC with Core i5 instead, for a family member. It works really well, is quiet, and you can put it anywhere as long as it has ventilation."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Interesting take but refreshing too.  I like all the different races mesh but then look at ""real"" life.  Somehow we all get along, sure we have our differences whether it's politically incorrect or infused"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This is a light weight suit.  It looked very nice on my 15 year old son when he gave a presentation.  It is nicely tailored.  It looks more expensive than it is because of the tailoring.  I hemmed it myself pretty easily by folding it inside out and sewing up the side seams enough to hold it in place.  He had no problems with it slipping and it looked professional. Usually I use Dritz stitch witchery iron on hem, which I love,  but I couldn't find it at the last minute."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Fits great very comfortable and easy to use. So much better than the last one I had. I love it its easy to put on easy to adjust and works well even for me and I am a very large chested women.
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,The slip on case slips off very easily. The screen protector did not stay on very well and made it difficult to use the touch screen. I would not trust this to hold the ipod while doing any type of physical activity other than walking. I tried to use it skiing and almost lost it. I liked the look and feel but it was a total waste for my purposes.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I just finished Barefoot Kisses, which was excellent, and then I saw this book! It's shorter, but sweet and hot, and fast paced. It was nice to return to the characters of Saltwater Kisses, too, which was the first Lakes book I ever read. As ever, clear writing, funny at times, and full of character."
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"Really easy to use, and works well.  It is a little pricey for a small screen, but is well worth the extra money.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a screen protector.  It will protect your screen from scratches and is very easy to install.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a screen protector."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This product is awesome! One of the best cases I have purchased to date for both iPad 2/3 (which have been many). It includes a built in screen protector, and looks to be very solid. The case snaps in the the protective case and then is protected by the rubber around the sides. There are slots that are protected for the rear camera and speaker, and all ports are covered. Very nice for the price. Highly recommended!

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Overall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either."

It works perfectly, and arrived  without dings, scratches or plastic anywhere in the product. I did put some boos butcher block cream on it since it's going to be exposed on my counter.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This Oxford Classics edition has much to recommend it. First, it is translated into smooth modern English, which, while not conveying every subtlety of Greek, will nontheless help the present-day reader through this long work. Second, the price is under $10. Third, there is an excellent map collection at the back showing the ancient world as we see it and as Herodotus saw it. The notes, bibliography, appendices, indexes, timeline and glossary all make this a great resource for the student or casual reader. There is enough mention of content in all the other reviews. I just wanted to point out the advantages of this edition."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this right after Christmas to use with my new iPhone.  It may be me and my klutziness, but it took me a while to position this in my ear so that it will not move or fall out.  Once you get accustomed to that, the piece is light and comfortable and easy to operate.  The sound quality is excellent and everyone tells me that my voice is ""as clear as a bell"" when I use this piece.  It's SIMPLE to set up and the controls, volume adjustment, etc, for me, have been a cinch.  Less meaningful to me is appearance, but it does look cool.  It has a sleek design and is not obtrusive.  I sometimes wear it all day and, unlike other headsets I've owned, is doesn't get ""heavy"" or uncomfortable.  Sometimes, I'm not even aware that it is on my ear.  This is my third Plantronics headpiece and I've had good luck with everyone of them. I would recommend this headpiece easily."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Supercharged is a novella told in Maxs point of view from Quarter Mile Hearts. I was so excited to see this novella that I immediately purchased it and read it.

I definitely think this novella adds to the Quarter Mile Hearts series. It begins before Quarter Mile Hearts and catches up with the story told within Quarter Mile Hearts. I totally loved that. I would recommend reading Supercharged before Quarter Mile Hearts.

Supercharged made me love Max even more and it even made me want to reread Quarter Mile Hearts because I missed this world so much. There were times I was extremely frustrated with Max because he kept trying to fit in instead of just marching to the beat of his own drum.

Overall, I really loved this novella and I cannot wait tor Reckless Hearts."

The author explains the reasons why it is so difficult to stay in the West, how it came about, and how to move back home. It is a great read, and I recommend it highly. I was so happy to see the first book in this series! I love the characters and their story line! It's very refreshing to see the characters in action again. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great read. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next one. This book is a must read for all of us. I couldn't put it down. I have to say I had a hard time putting it down. It was a story that I was deeply interested in. I love the characters and the story line. I thought this was a great book to read.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book, the things that I liked were also the things that I didn't. Maddie for example, was this sweet girl-woman and throughout the book, it is revealed how much a victim this young girl really was. At the same time, I thought that is exactly what makes her such a complex character to read about. If this was reality, then I would not feel this way, because I think that her overcoming the abuse was so much a part of the story, it would be the furthest thing from entertaining for me to read. For this reason and a few others, one being the connection between Caden and Maddie that was choppy at times, I don't know if I would ever want to read this book again. There is definitely a difference  between the last two books by SM and the earlier ones in this series, one of the problems being that there have been huge breaks between books, and while I want to read a nicely finished book, this just caused me to forget and not care anymore.
I gave the book 4 stars because when Maddie and Caden were at odds with one another, it was written such that I really felt what they were struggling with and for that the author deserves credit. When they were reconciling, Caden showed absolutely the right amount of gentleness I wanted him too. Honestly,  the part where the conflict with his own family was not explained enough, I was  able to take at face value as I would not want to read pages and pages about the extremely violent circumstances of those times, a couple of sentences thrown in here and there were quite enough for me. All in all, a good addition to this series, but not a hot romance as I would like to have read from  SM."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These boots were a gift for my wife. When she first put them on they seemed a little small. I do recommend ordering a size larger than your regular shoe size. That is your boot size.
She has been wearing them for a week and they have loosened a slight bit. She doesn't mind the snug fit, because they are faux fur lined and she doesn't wear socks with them anyway. They are mostly to pull on quickly for going out of the house to check the mail, take out the dogs, etc.
They are warm and cozy and are exactly what I hoped they would be."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed this book.  I loved the main character and that fact that she stuck out as a misfit in the society that she found herself thrust into.  It was thrilling as each moment the main characters found themselves together they became more entangled in their attraction to each other.  The last bit was a delightful twist.  I didn't see that twist coming and it lead perfectly into the ""happily ever after"" resolution."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage Set-This 3 piece set arrived within 2 days. Thanks Amazon Prime! I have to say WOW! I am pleasantly surprised by the quality. This particular set is in WHITE with a shiny finish featuring a vertical grooved pattern. I'm hoping the pattern will prevent denting. There is a protective clear plastic wrap encasing the set. Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper. It compresses your clothing & frees up valuable space. As I visualize the airline terminal staff tossing my luggage into the back of a transport vehicle & loading tons of luggage on the conveyer belt, I have a feeling these 3 pieces will survive the airport onslaught. Love this my new luggage."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The bags are about the size of a plastic bag, a bag can be wadded up inside your fist and becomes as small as your hand; and can easily be carried in a pocket or other.  I keep one in my bike basket.  The item expands much larger than a plastic bag however.  These hold a lot of items, and a lot of weight.  Yes, if you have delicate items like breads mixed with canned goods, you'll likely squish the bread as the bag doesn't have the stability of a paper bag, so things shift when you grab the handles.  But, if you get a lot of ""like"" items such as produce, it can be filled with more weight than I carry they are that durable.  Just bring a 2nd along for the delicate items so they can be bagged separately."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food). Let me ask you, can you tell me how much food was consumed in your household this week? I cant."

I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I didn't think it possible but I believe this book was better than the last one. It needs a better editor but the story is really good. It centers on the Weathers family and JD (Justice) in particular. He has 2 teenaged boys, twins, Briggs and Dawson. He's a widower and carries a lot of guilt and anger. When his wife died he was having a fling with a woman who really got to him. Then he found out that his wife took her life, not because of him but because of her own nature. That's a whole other ball of wax. Anyway his father agrees to be interviewed by the star of a show that showcases western lifestyles, because the original story was about his family as a kid and what had become of them. That led to Jason, JD's father.well turns out that the woman doing the interviews is the woman he had that weekend with, that he can't seem to forget. Needless to say the story gets ever so much more interesting when she hits town. OMG, this book has it all- action, kidnapping, romance, an angel and so much more. I couldn't stop reading it. Just had to get to the end! Too good! Hard to believe but it's true.it helps to read the first book but it can be read as a standalone book."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nine Lorien teenagers were sent to earth to await their legacies, special powers that each possess, in order to return to their planet to save it. Number Four, Daniel Jones, is moving from Florida to Paradise, Ohio, with his new name, John Smith, and his Cepan, or guardian, Henri.

In Paradise, John tries to start a life as he acquaints himself with Sarah Hart, a friendly, smart ex-cheerleader. Of course, with an ex-cheerleader there's an ex-boyfriend, Mark James, who isn't so happy about the chemistry between John and Sarah. As John begins to fall for Sara, she becomes another person who would be in danger from the Mogadorians, another alien race that are hunting the Lorien teens.

Each Lorien teen is at a different place on Earth. Three have already been caught and killed, which is made clear through the scars on each of the remaining teens' ankles. As another one dies, another scar will appear in order to determine who will be hunted next. Because of a charm, the nine teens must be killed in their chronological order. As number four, John knows he's next.

Despite its controversial co-author, one can't argue that I AM NUMBER FOUR reads just like a script, so it's no surprise that it has been turned into a movie. The novel itself has scenes that are so action-packed, with a little romance thrown in, that it will captivate readers of all ages.

With the sequel, THE POWER OF SIX, releasing in August 2011, only read I AM NUMBER FOUR if you are willing to become addicted to another series.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?

I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit.

There's lots of action, a main character with a troubled past, and a host of alien races. The alien look and think differently than humans, which makes it all the more engaging.
Lieutenant Gray is a fighter pilot with good instincts, but when the Sh'daar issue an ultimatum, he joins the space navy to protect his home world. The odds seem hopeless. What can one carrier fleet do against a galaxy wide empire? Go they will, because if they don't, humanity will become the next race in a long line to serve the alien masters."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I'm very pleased with the 4th addition update of The C++ Programming Language.

Dr. Stroustrup takes the approach of presenting the current version of the language (C++ 11) as a whole, rather than attempting to show what's new in C++ 11 compared to C++ 03.  At approximately 1300 pages of text, it takes commitment to make it through the entirety of the content, but you'll most likely be a better programmer if you do.

If you've attempted to read previous versions and didn't like Stroustrup's approach, then you probably won't like the new edition either.  On the other hand, if you appreciated the 3rd edition, you will probably like the 4th edition as well.

He presents the language in a rather terse style of writing with very short and fairly contrived examples, so it's probably not the best book for beginners.  On the other hand, if you are already an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer, he explains a lot of the finer points very clearly.  Some of the topics he addresses are difficult to find documented elsewhere. For example the precise type of literals -- 3, ""foo"", 4.0, 5.1f;  internal vs external linkage; unnamed namespaces; etc. Since he invented the language and is a very active member of the standards committee, you can trust that the information is accurate.

One of the other things I like about this book is the fact that Stroustrup is wiling to editorialize just a bit and describe things that he considers to be ugly, embarrassing, or bad style.  He manages to do this without ranting, which is really nice.  He also gives advice about constructs to avoid and techniques to embrace.

Happy reading and good luck!"

It is not as sexy looking as its predecessor of the same model; blocky versus the sleek curves, but I don't see it so that doesn't bother me.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Sometimes you read a book that you just devour. You inhale it. It consumes you. This is what The Perfect Life did to me.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise."

The price is great.  I bought a $250 50-100 F1.4 lens for $8.99.  I am glad I bought it because it is the only lens that I know of that I use for shooting at night, and I don't need to use the flash.  I will be buying a second one for the future.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money."

Kennedy had a strong group of friends too; in Julien, Reece and Grant.  We already know Reece's story and I'm sure Grant and Julien's are going to be Fab.  Although they were together for Reece's bachelor party, they really had Kennedy's back.

As eccentric as Julien is, he helped Kennedy see sense and made him realize he had been a fool.

As did Bella with Mackenzie, I loved the interaction between Mackenzie and her neighbor and his dog, she has a really caring nature.

The sexy scenes were fab, and I needed to fan myself more than once, not to mention other forms of relief :) !

I felt that although the story ended on a very good positive note, it would be great to have seen how they got on with the moratorium they had agreed to.

Looking forward to finding out more about Julien or will it be Grant in the next book.  Love your work Sierra !"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This the second part of the Hero trilogy and it's more suspenseful than the first. The sexual tension and frustration is still thick between Haze and  Leighton. The story is so well written that as the reader, you feel frustrated yourself. You want these two to just throw away the excuses and realize they are better together than they are apart. With how this one ended, I hope they do.  Frustrating but the tension and suspense makes it worth the read."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"video review: https://youtu.be/F9Z23AZ814c

This is a really well made Bluetooth device. It comes packed nicely. It comes with spare ear holder things and earbuds pieces. It has amazing battery life on standby and on call time as well. It is smaller than I expected but fits comfortably.
I like that it has a double sided tape on the dock that allows to stick it on the wall. It also comes with another piece to clip onto the vent of your car. It looks really nice.

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest and unbiased review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"it is larger than an actual steak, and the instructions are a little misleading. I was hoping to get an extra slice of beef, but that is the only thing I can say about this product. Update:

I was able to get a 4"" steak cut from the manufacturer, but it was a bit of a pain to cut the steak with a knife. I will say that I had to use a different knife to get it cut with a knife, so I have not had to get one yet. The smaller cut I got is better quality, but I still have a steak cut that is a bit smaller than the one I got."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Nice case.  Swallowed a Sabertooth x99 with H100 water cooler with only very minor hiccups.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I love this little gadget and have used it a handful of times during this cold season. Sad to see that they are no longer available. The instructions are pretty clear and I just can't get over how awesome and easy it is to simply place the device in a cup of water. Growing up, we always had the huge R2D2-style contraptions posted up in our hallway during the winter months - given that it was in a house made sense but it was always a pain to refill. This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too. Once it's plugged in and you hit the power button, a nice, steady mist comes out.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,It starts with a young women coming out of a drugged like daze walking across a parking lot to a car she doesnt recognize but has the keys to it in her pocket. She wants to go home but has no idea where that might be.  As she starts driving she sees a highway sign that she thinks looks familiar so she turns on to it in the direction that she thinks might take her home.  After hours of driving she pulls up to a house she thinks is her home and knocks on the door.  The door is opened by her shocked husband and finds out shes been gone for seven months and has no memory of where shes been or why.  The next day she tells her husband that she wants to retrace her route to see where shes been and why. Now things really get strange but interesting. Its a really good plot and worth reading.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book is a masterpiece.  It deals with the making of a geisha and how she is practically a prisoner to her sponsors,even after she becomes a full fledged geisha.  It is so emotionally written with such perfect narration that you literally do not want the book to end. At a very young age our heroine is sold to a geisha house to prevent her from starvation and death.  It is a fate that is chosen for her and she must oblige, it is better than dying or is it?  Written with such beautiful words and creating a mood that you swear you are in Japan.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I have to say, I got this book out of chance and have to put out there that I feel bad I hadn't known about this title before.

This story is basically a modern day Romeo and Juliet but that hype of Shakespeares' master work never wore the story down for me. Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person her and her family have known to despise, however, as the reader starts to grasp the power of love in this novel...it gives judgment a whole new meaning.

Mary E. Pearson knows what she's doing. I love the surprise, twist'n turns and the balance of drama, romance, and mystery in this novel. I'd recommend this to any young adult who are looking for that classic love story that we all love with a guarantee of a soft, exciting, original teen love romance. This book will have you appreciate and be more hopeful for that special person that you may or may not have come across in life.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.
This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"I'm going to do this book for free. It is a great book for a beginner to start. I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it. The characters are well written and well developed. I would highly recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story line, and the fact that they all had a very positive impact on the reader. I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job with the language and the plot. I think it would be great if the story line would have been more developed. I am hoping that the author will take this author to the next level. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more time to get into the characters. I love this series. I was waiting for the next book to come out. I love the characters and how the story unfolded.

It was very much Fifty Shades of Grey in the gaming world, and parts were a little like Pretty Woman, but both with a more independent and intelligent heroine.  The only distractions were that the entire book needs an editor to proofread it, and maybe a little too much detail about what the main characters were wearing.  Oh, and the techie terms and name pronunciations should have been up front or referenced at the beginning.  Looking forward to reading more from this author!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've spent years hitting and missing this whole idea of carrying my shopping bags into the store with me when I go shopping -- so i don't have to carry paper or plastic out with me when I leave...  The Chico-Bags finally fixed the problem of leaving them at home -- leaving them in the car -- having too many or not enough....

since each bag wads up into a little light-weight ball of nothing -- and has a clip -- I just clip one to my bag and leave it there all the time.  I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Haven't been without them since.

And now everybody I know will be getting them for their birthday....  :D

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nothing to Lose is vintage Jack Reacher.  This time he's in Colorado, heading to San Diego from Calais, Maine.  The locals there pronounce it 'callous' and that speaks to part of Jack's character, the part that arises when he's challenged unnecessarily.  The 'challenger' here is Despair, CO, a few miles from Hope, CO, a few miles from Halfway, CO.  Despair is a company town.  It's also a pivotal element of the classic western plot in which the hero stumbles upon a boondock town in which everyone, especially the law, conspires against him.  The law in this case tells Jack to depart, forthwith, and for no apparent reason.  Jack is not one to follow irrational orders, particularly from individuals with no authority over him, and he sets out to discover the secret(s) of Despair, with the help of a policewoman from Hope.

Lee Child's new novel points up his almost unique ability to take a simple plot with simple elements and turn it into a compelling, irresistibly insistent narrative.  By the time we reach the end we discover that things are far less simple than they appear.  They are also a bit too complex for plausibility's sake, but by then we are caught up in the wave and are carried to the powerful conclusion.

Another strong outing for Jack.  While perhaps not his strongest, it is stronger than whatever's in second place.  Highly recommended."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed."

I took the third one and the fourth one and now it's a little smaller.  I'm glad I did.  I'm happy I did.  I'm not a fan of the sound quality of the speakers on these computers.  They are very loud and the speakers are not as loud as they sound.  It's very annoying.  I have to get my computer speakers to work, and I'm not sure how long I'll have to wait.  They work great.  The sound quality is not great, but it's ok.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.This is a great camera for the price.  I was able to find some great reviews for it, but I haven't found any good ones.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price.I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this.  The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the lens is a bit wide open, so you can see your subject better without the ability to see where you are looking.  I had a little trouble getting it to open, but after a few minutes it was just a little bit wider.  I am very happy with the camera and would buy again.  The quality is good.I've had this for 2 months now.  It works great, but I'm not sure if it's because I have it plugged in and connected to a different router.  I haven't tried to switch to the router,"

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

This is a great book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!

I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.

The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.

If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to."

The instructions are easy to follow and it took me 20 minutes to put in and tighten the screws.  I find it has good back support and the adjustable arms fit nicely with my computer desk.  The chair swivels easily and is adjustable in height.

I don't think it was overpriced because I searched the web and found it reasonable."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I have read and loved every one of the prior KGI books in the series.  The relationship of PJ (the heroine), and Cole(the hero) in the earlier books was one of the same bantering which occurs among all the other KGI operatives, so it strains the credulity when Shades of Gray begins with Cole inexplicably flying to PJ's home town, and then they jump into bed by page 10 or 11!!!  As KGI teammates, they have always cared about each other, so why, when these two otherwise likeable leading characters make love, was it necessary for Maya Banks to write that they each called their physical loving by the ""F"" word?? This is unnecessary crassness, and a big turn-off to the reader. Nevertheless, I will still be hoping for another  KGI  book featuring  Steele as the hero."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these as a gift for my 20 year old son.  He is notoriously hard to buy shoes for.  Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

I was burned. You don't have to be."

The characters are strong, likable, and likable.  There is a lot of angst and angst.  There are moments of anger, betrayal, and even forgiveness.

Sacrifice, Book 1, needs to be read before this one so that all of the background information on the tribute program and the world they live on is explained.  Kai Mexr was Commander Rehzs right hand man and was supposed to retire when his last mission ended, but he was forced to come back as a trainer for another mission.  His new trainee is Aled Price another person with human genetics and stubborn streak a mile wide.  Kai and Aled butt heads from the very beginning, but realize that they need each other to survive.  They have to deal with the harsh realities of training, and when that is over, the treatment at the hands of the Ungrich.  Palk set his sights on Kai and his trainee and makes sure his presence is felt to both men.  Aled realizes that Kai doesnt believe he deserves better than being taken roughly and without any choices in how he is taken, but trying to make Kai see that he deserves more may be battle too big for Aled.  We see Anna and Rehz in this book as well since the Ungrich seem to have set their sights on human DNA.  Both pairs realize that if their secret is not protected then they will be targets for the military to use them.  When Aled goes in to get his medical clearance and to finally be free to pursue a life with Kai, he is taken for the Ungrich, as is Anna.  Both Kai and Rehz now need to join forces and go rescue their mates.  This book ends on a cliffhanger.  I give this book 4 stars!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,This watch serves my son well. The design is comfortable and looks nice. He loves the colors.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Great product.  Stores all my blankets, pillows and winter clothes in neat small spaces."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support. ALL OF THIS SAID, your results may vary of course!"
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"The first item tht I noticed was the fact that it was a lot thinner than the other one. If you had a thinner screen, it would have been a lot thinner. The screen was a little smaller than the one I was using. This is a problem for me. I used it with a Samsung phone and a Galaxy Note 3 and it worked perfectly. I have had no problems with it. I am very happy with it. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it had a built in speaker. Pros:
-Good sound quality
-Low cost
-Excellent quality

Cons:
-High price
-Low sound quality

This is a great product for the price."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I was so excited when I saw that this eARC had dropped on to my Kindle.

From the first page, I was drawn in to the world of Keely & Ronan and just from the prologue I was like ""dammmnnnn this is gonna be good""

I read this book in a few hours, non stop. Whilst I really enjoyed aspects of it, I also felt like something was lacking to give it that X Factor ya know?

I was intrigued to find out what happened for Ronan to leave all them years ago, however when it finally came out I was like hmm okay then.

Also, 60% before we get some bow chicka wow wow, and even that was just a finger bang! Still had to wait a wee while for some full on loving ;)

I freaking loved Ronan with Emma, right from the get go - so freaking swoonworthy!! and the Epilogue part - gah perfection!!

Ok, so yeah - whilst i Loved the story in general, I felt it was lacking in the usual Ella Fox finesse."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"I'm a 32F, but usually find that most 32DDD's will fit me more comfortably. That said, I thought this bra would be a winner. They offered my size, and it's such a cute bra (a hard find for sizes D & up). Unfortunately, if you are like me, this bra will absolutely not fit you. The 32DDD is more of a 32 C or D. Especially with all the padding. When it arrived, I took one look at it and knew it was a dream best to be forgotten. Other bras in this size that I bought fit me fine- the Wacoal 32DDD was perfect, but this one particular bra was just so outrageously the wrong size that I want to warn other women: If you are a 32D or up, this bra is not for you, no matter what the sizes say."

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"The 25-pack I bought before this one arrived was very good.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box itself is a bit small, but it does take up most of the room.  It does have a small case for the phone and an adapter.  The only thing I would change is to the case that comes with the case.  I wish I could get one of those, but I don't think that would be a problem.This is a great product for the price. It works as expected. I use it with my ipod and it works very well.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"This was a tough one for me, I wanted to like this so badly and gave it multiple chances but honestly I just couldn't finish the book. It's just terribly difficult to follow from one chapter to the next when the focus shifts from one character to the next. I really liked the movie and thought the book would be great but sadly its one of the few times where I actually liked the movie better than the book. Where the movie benefits from the unique story, the book struggles with it as it just makes it too difficult to follow."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"This blender does everything I wanted it to do, and I'm happy with it. I just wish the two top blades were different, but they're the same blades. The only thing that I do like about this one is that it's a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it's still a good product. I'm very happy with it.I've had this for about a year now and I love it!  The color is great and the very soft feel makes it very comfortable to be in the kitchen.  I love that it has a built-in fan and it makes it easy to use.  The only negative thing I have is that it is a little too large for my small kitchen.  I can't think of a reason for that.  I was hoping it would be the size of my small kitchen but I'm glad I didn't.  I'm not sure if that's because of the large size but the size is just too small for my small kitchen.

The sound quality is great. Really. And it's super easy and obvious to pair/Unpair the Bluetooth. The light is quite bright.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"** spoiler alert ** I liked the first Jack Reacher book but Die Trying was a mess. ***Warning Spoilers***. Very little worked for me in this book. A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting caught and the bad guys still don't kill him. Ok, that's a thriller trope, I can live with that, but it's pretty extreme in here.. None of the FBI agents behave like you would expect an FBI agent to. We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch. Militia members would know that so Child comes off sounding like a neophyte."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought my sg3 brand new about 5/6 yrs ago, it still works like a champ til this day. Played a round this past Saturday.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles like the newer models, but its accurate, links to the satellite in 1 or 2 mins, gives me carried yardage, hazard yardage (front and carry), distance to middle, front and back of greens, you can use the small joystick to place the pin in appropriate place on green for more accurated pin yardage. It has a score feature, but it takes to long to get to the next hole, so I have this feature turned off. All in all, I LOVE IT, they don't make this model anymore, but I bet the refurbished sg3 is just as good, unless your into color screens, touch screens and other things that slows your game down.  This one gives you what you need, accurate yardage to hazards, lay ups and pin, so all you need is good golf shot.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

So far I haven't seen any issues.  Without the hub on the far end I do not get a reliable signal for a simple USB keyboard.  I have seen this with other cables once you get past 30', so I expected this and I accepted this.  One could argue that this should be noted and perhaps even built-in to these cables.

The only drawback is that the keys are slightly larger than standard keyboards.  The keys are also not as long as standard keys but I think it will be a problem for some people.  I also like the tactile feedback on the keys.  The ergonomics of the keyboard are very good.  The keys are also very easy to press.  I love that the keys are not just a big rectangle but are spaced apart.  The keyboard is a little too big for my hands.  The keys are also slightly larger than standard keys.  It is a nice touch to have.  The buttons are a little too small for my hands but the feel of the keyboard is very good.

I really like the keyboard.  It is very well made.  The keys are a bit small and small enough that the button placement is not very precise.  The keyboard is well made.  I have not used it yet but I will be sure to update my review.  I would recommend it to anyone.

I'm a bit disappointed.  This is my second pair.  I'm looking forward to wearing them to the Macy's in the fall.  I like the way they look.Love these!These are my favorite.  I have a hard time finding jeans that fit me comfortably, but I have a hard time finding jeans that don't fit.  These jeans are super comfortable and have a great price point.  I have some great jeans to wear for work, but these are the only jeans that I wear for work or for my family.  I will be buying more!  I have a lot of compliments on them.I love these shoes. I love the color and the fit. They fit my body well and are comfortable. I have a wide foot and these fit me well.

I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and these fit well. I would recommend them.I wear a size 11.5 in jeans and this fits perfect. I have a narrow foot and this fits perfect. It is very comfortable and fits great.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Countdown is a short prequel to the Newsflesh series. I have previously reviewed the first two books in the series: Feed and Deadline. I read the Kindle version of Countdown so it didn't have page numbers but I think it probably has only about 65 pages. It's a detailed account of the days in 2014 leading up to The Rising.

Mira Grant is an excellent world builder. Adding more details to the story of how the Kellis-Amberlee virus was created and spread only made the possibility that something like that could really happen seem even more believable to me. There wasn't any brand new information in this book but it was a nice dose of the Newsflesh world to help tide me over until the final book, Blackout, is released this summer. I highly recommend Countdown for fans of the Newsflesh series."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"My father read this book to me the first year it was published. I was nine and it has been on my bookshelf since. I can't tell you how many copies of this I have purchased for people.
This is a great book to encourage thinking, not simply memorizing. Each page contains new language, new ideas, new ways to play with learning. It also happens to be a wonderful story. I may have been too young at nine to read it on my own, but certainly it is a great read-aloud for children nine or a bit younger. At nine, I didn't understand all the fancies, but like the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland, this book succeeds on many levels.
The Phantom Tollbooth encourages a child's love for language. It paints wonderful pictures (with the help of Feiffer's charming line drawings). It is as perfect a thing as can be written.
Oh, and if you're an adult without any children at home - buy the book for yourself. It will take you away from the Doldrums and into the Kingdom of Wisdom where your spirit can be renewed."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I enjoy this series for the facts that it is science fiction and erotic and a little kick ass. I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Talk about drama. Forever and Always by E.L. Todd is the sequel to Only for You. Honestly, I didn't care for this book as much as I was hoping. The reader can figure out real quick what is about to happen.

So, before this book, Sean, our hero, has made it to Seattle and has professed his love and apology to Scarlet. Enter a really fast and quick relationship followed by prego ex-girlfriend and a bunch of mess. I wanted to smack the hell out of the main characters. Sean didn't learn anything from the first book. He was still a complete doofus.

Scarlet was even worse. Instead of swallowing her pride, she nearly cost the destruction of her business. Not to mention, when she did swallow her pride, it was for the wrong reason. Sorry, hate to say this, but I didn't care for where it ended. Sure, time passed, but I felt that another book of them growing together versus a little tidbit about six months later, would have been the better choice.

As always with E.L. Todd, the writing isn't bad. It is quick and easy to pull through. Despite my dislike for these characters, I did like her writing enough to finish the book. I also like that Janice made an appearance and that Scarlet did grow a pair for her friend. I still feel Scar could have done something before this book, but I'm glad she did the right thing.

Really, the book wasn't bad, I just didn't care for where it was going where Sean and Scarlet are concerned."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Anna Pigeon is a jack of all trades. Not only is she a park ranger with law enforcement training, but she's also an emergency medical technician and a trained firefighter. One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees, but quibbles aside, this is a superb book. Barr uses the drama of a fire to isolate her cast of characters in classic locked-room mystery fashion, then cuts them off from the outside world while Anna races against time to figure out who she can trust before she becomes the next victim. If there's a flaw it lies in the fact that a vital clue is a bit too obvious. I can't say more without giving away too much, but people who've read lots of mysteries will probably figure out part of what's going on simply from the way the story is constructed. Firestorm, however, is really a story of fire, firefighters, and the southern Cascades in the vicinity of Mt. Lassen National Park, and minor imperfections in the mystery barely detract from it at all. Highly recommended."

Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.

I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain. Fearing it might be carpal tunnel, I ended up doing a bunch of hand stretches, and also replaced by keyboard with the amazon basics keyboard I was using before. I think the stretches helped fix damage that was done, and using the keyboard prevented any further damage from building up. My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

As I use the headset longer, if I find more Apps that it won't work with, I'll come back and update my review."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The second book in the Asylums for Magical Threats series is mesmerizing paranormal romance that takes the reader on an adventure.  Fighting to free elemental magic users, Camilla Melini is on a mission to find one of the legendary Four Talents. Marco Alvarez is sent to Mexico with two goals  to watch Cams back and to investigate a series of arson fires. Despite their differences they will have to work together to save their colleagues and to keep the Talent from falling into the wrong hands.

This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.  The author uses well written scenes and events to inspire vivid images that capture the imagination.  Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.

The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes. The bad guys in this series really inspire outrage and anger, only thing is there are so many plots and conflicts going on, the reader not really sure which ones are the bad guys, which of course keeps things real interesting.

The author has created a fascinating world of elemental magic that has surprising twists and turns, intriguing subplots and captivating characters with dazzling abilities that ensure that the reader never gets bored and I was engrossed in this thrilling story from beginning to end and I cant wait to find out what happens next."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"While I love an action romance story like everyone else,what I can't get is when the editing is poor that it takes away from the story.

The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe.

The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well."

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I've had this one on my TBR list for a while and when it went on sale for 99 cents it was time to one click and read. The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a knife that won't break if you want to sharpen it.I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to cook.  It was a gift for my son who was a huge fan of my cookbook.  The reason I got this was to make my son cook for me and he loves to cook for me.  My son loves to cook with me.  I was going to buy a second set of this because I really like the color and the finish of the books.  It's a really nice quality book.  I just wish it had a darker background.  I love that it has a small red tag that says ""Made in USA.""  I would also like that it has a description for the book that says ""Made in China.""  I also like that it has a nice green color.  It is really nice to have an accent that makes my son feel like he's a real person.  It is a perfect addition to my kitchen.  I also like that the book has a sharp edge that makes it easier to cut with ease.  It is very easy to read and works well.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good cookbook.  This is a very good product"

Size/Color:  9.5/10.

Warmness:  Medium.

Size:  9.5/10.

I was unsure about the size of the hat but I'm glad I found it! I will be buying more hats soon!I love these shoes! They are very comfortable and look great! I wear them to work and they are a perfect size for me. They have a nice quality leather feel and are very comfortable. They also run small so I usually wear a size 8 and am happy with that.

They are not as big as I thought they would be but they are well made and I love the color! They look great and I like the quality. I wish they had the support that I need. I have a large head and these are perfect!

They run a little large but I like that they are a little smaller than I thought they would be. The material is thin and very soft. I love that they don't feel like they have a zipper, which is great. I would recommend them to anyone!I have a pair of the shoes.  They fit perfect.

For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability. Makes rice perfect every time once you get the water amount for your particular rice right. Which is true of any rice cooker. Very simple to use. Two modes, cook, and warm.

Books_5,2.0,CG,"There and Now - Engaging, an entertaining story about a small town in the middle of nowhere, and a two-story apartment building, both with its own mysterious shadows. The reader is entranced by the juxtaposition of life in this small town with the rich and famous. The book is a fast read with a great amount of entertainment.I loved this book. It has great twists and turns. This book is a must read for any young adult. It's very easy to understand and understand the text. You won't be disappointed.I'm not sure how I feel about this book.  I am a sucker for suspense and it's hard to read a book that is so full of surprises and twists.  However, I loved this book and was looking forward to it all.  I wish I had the book sooner.  I'm not a fan of the idea of the author being so powerful that she has to hide behind a cover.  I'm not a fan of the author getting away with it, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these."
Electronics_5,4.0,CG,I bought this case because it has the quality and design of a lot of other cases.  It is so small that it is a must have for the iPhone 4S.

The case is made of high quality materials and the case is very comfortable.

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years."

The only downside is that it's very small. The mount is designed to be a little too large for a regular tripod. It's not a huge deal, but it is very heavy for such a small mount.

The only downside I can think of is that the auto-focus ring has a tendency to lose focus. I tried to reset it by putting it on the tripod, and it will not do that. I don't know why. I've tried other options, but I just couldn't get it to work.

I do recommend it to anyone looking for a tripod.This is a great product.  I have to say it works perfectly for my camera.

If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This book was raw with emotion from page 1 and starts from after that awful day that changed Diana from the carefree person she was to a person who struggles daily with demons.  You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all of his own demons he fought the hardest for Diana.

We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.

As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.  He is also trying to deal with the fact that he was unable to save her.  Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.

Gideon and Dianas relationship continues to grow, helps both of them heal with the aftermath of that day.  In the end they both were each others saviors."

For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story.."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer)."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

To see what N.K.'s idea behind Brandon's reflection was head over to the HEA blog!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The cord was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love sandals, especially since I live in the Phoenix area where it is sandal weather nearly year-round.  I have many, many brands of sandals from cheapie flip-flops to expensive dressy low-heel sandals, to go with all manner of clothing, casual to classy. However, I think I have found my perfect sandal with these!  Comfort, style and support - all-in-one.  I have a casual colored pair now, but can easily state that other colors will meet the nearly classy mode for slack outfits.  I have a high in-step and these sandals support every millimeter of my soles. The adjustable straps would allow for wider feet, although with my narrow feet, I could easily want a bit more tighter fit; however, foot movement is minimal due to  tri-band construction of these beautiful sandals. My new goal is to begin the process of getting these sandals in all the colors that fit my clothing/color style...which may be all of them!!!!

PROs:
Little to no break-in time required!!! Honest!
Great fit with adjustable straps...all three straps!
Excellent supporting foot-bed.
Quality materials.  Love the leather smell!
Flexibility. Sandal can flex in perfect harmony with natural body movement.
Sole - perfect on all surfaces!
Decorative medallions and bead - adds a touch of fun!
Fit - true to size...I wear a 6.5 - 7.0 and a 7 was just slightly bigger as I would expect in a quality shoe that comes only in whole sizes.
Love the mixed colored selections and the metallic leather choices!

CONs:
None....I tried very hard to find a negative in these sandals but could not come up with one.  Oh, perhaps I wish there were even more colors!  Patent black leather, cream, silver, light blue..."

I do really like the watch though, it's comfortable -- that's huge for me because I usually can't wear things on my fingers or wrists for a long time and I've had the watch on already for two days.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Dan Edwardes' introduction to parkour is a well-written and well-organized introduction to parkour, but unfortunately it's too basic and shallow an introduction.  I do not think the first instinct of people who are interested in learning about parkour will be to buy a book -- there are too many entertaining youtube videos that offer a sexy taste of what parkour is like.  And serious readers won't read this book about parkour -- there isn't any intellectual weight to the book, not enough about parkour's history and the psychology of its adherents.  I think the vast majority of people who buy this book (including myself) are novice practitioners looking for a reference book, especially on more complicated movements and proper technique -- and on this front this book sorely disappoints."

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Doesn't seem to work well with Mac devices. My USB 3.0 hard drive keep connecting and disconnecting repeatedly.

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

I will tinker with it a little more but if I cannot get it to stop this connecting/disconnecting to stop I might have to return the unit and look for another alternative."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Sometimes it is so hard to find a loose comfortable tank top. So often they are tight fitting, so I was happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band.
I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but reviews said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sports bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute.  The color was exactly how it looked in the picture.
I am glad I opted for the medium cause this does appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it makes it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat.
This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That was really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair ties that you can only use once.
I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pants and still looks great. You can really even use it as a bathing suit cover if you would like.

The first book in the series was the prequel, Prequel 2, and I'm a fan. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I love how the author wrote the descriptions of the characters. I liked the fact that they were all over the place. There was also the fact that the author had to use a lot of language. It was like a well written story.

I liked the fact that the author used a lot of words and it made the story more realistic. I think that the author would have used some of the things that could have been used for a different story.

I liked the fact that the author kept the main character's name and family name. I also liked that the author used a lot of slang.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller."

Amy is just moving from Paris back to Chicago. Emily, Marcus sister, ask him to help Amy find a position in Chicago. What a surprise when they both meet and realize the connection and the instant attraction. Neither does relationships. That is until neither can keep their hands off each other. Amy grew up upper crust in Chicago. Interesting interaction upon her return.

Highly recommend this series."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This story about the Russian plot to knock out all electronic
communications in the US and thereby take over with their own President
makes another unique story and realistic reading. DeMille continues to
provide great dialog, emotionally interesting characters and suspense
throughout the book. Can't put the book down. The reappearance of one
of the main characters after a so-called parachuting accident is a
good twist. Also the flashbacks and the reappearance of intelligence
officers after 30 years is a good plot line. Which of them are the bad
guys is not answered until the very end with some great surprises!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."

I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" baking is too thin to bake for my family. I wish they were the ones that made the muffins more flaky. I gave them a 4 because I was concerned that they might get a little too thick. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'm sure they will last for a long time. I have not used them yet, but will be putting them in a couple of weeks.

I recently met Dr. Lienhard at a book signing in which he graciously answered questions from an audience and took time to converse with buyers while autographing their purchases. Dr. Lienhard has the knack of bringing the scholar's intellect to the study of culture and technology without the slightest condescension. We briefly discussed Vermeer's use of the ""camera obscura"" which led to a brief exchange about the inevitability of ""photography"" and the ways in which it has, in turn, shaped our lives.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"A comic novel about the love affairs of a sophisticated, thirtyish single woman living alone in a big city and working in television - sound familiar? If you haven't read Bridget Jones's Diary yet you may be more impressed by the originality of this. Of course lack of originality doesn't detract from entertainment value. Maybe we should just accept that there is now a genre/category (sometimes called called chick-lit) within which some authors chose to write. The heroine, called Jane Goodall is pre-occupied with a man who rejects her (plot lifted from Virgil's about Aeneas and Dido) and plans revenge (plot lifted from Euripides about Medea and Jason) which she does by writing  (derived from evo-psychology) magazine articles about why men are unfaithful to their lovers. The quotations from animal behavior studies are among the best jokes.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.

Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.

They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.

This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.

A highly recommended read.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Books about successful technology companies are usually written by the entrepreneurs who founded the companies. It is truly remarkable for a book about a company which has grown from nothing to one of the largest computer companies in the world, written by an employee with a HR background and another employee with a diversity background. However, that is what we find with this book by Gina Qiao and Yolanda Conyers, suggesting that the key features of the company are at least as much tied up in its attitude towards employees and diversity as they are in the actual products the company sells.

The book describes a company which began with a group of Chinese scientists who had no commercial experience. Starting by renting out their expertise, then becoming distributors for international computer brands, then creating a Chinese-language motherboard, Legend Computers gradually grew to a position of dominance in the Chinese market before changing its English name to Lenovo and turning its ambitions towards a global market.

Many international companies have suffered culture shocks trying to take over Chinese companies; this book described the culture shocks Lenovo faced digesting the acquisition of the IBM personal computers business. A typical multinational company has a headquarters and dominant culture in one country; Lenovo has chosen not to pursue that route. It has adopted English as its language of businesses, requiring a significant sacrifice on the part of its founders and original staff. In different parts of the world, local culture prevails, rather than a monolithic head-office-imposed culture.

This book describes one way in which a truly international company can succeed, but it requires a lot of trust-building and willingness to sacrifice ones own interests. According to the authors:

We don't just say nice words about cultural diversity; we live it. That is the Lenovo Way."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.

For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.

Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.

In short, RIVER MONSTERS is an appealing, exciting and insightful guide to aquatic wonders that - may still - lurk in freshwater rivers. Recommended."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I. Loved. This. Book. LOVED IT!!  Which is funny, because I normally don't read contemporary books that often and I hate romance.  And this book was a contemporary romance.  Yet I fell in love with it!  It is freaking hilarious.  I love the author's humor, and I was laughing out loud over and over again.  I am so glad I wasn't reading this book in public because I would have gotten some looks.  I absolutely adored the characters - Etienne is hot and I wish he were mine, and Anna is so easy to relate to.  I don't feel like I read about these characters; I feel like I am actually friends with them.  I loved the charming Parisian setting and details; I felt like I was there in Paris.  The book is utterly believable, and it had me hooked from the first page.  I could not put it down!  I stayed up til three in the morning to finish it, and then I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about it!  This is a magical, funny, romantic novel and I would love to give it six stars instead of five.  Stephanie Perkins will be penning two more companion novels in the next year or so and I am very excited!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work.

My curiosity kept me going and by the end I found myself really interested in what was going to happen to poor Evie. Is she going to make it? Will she come to terms with what is happening to her or will her mortal body fail? I guess I'm going to have to find out lol. There is explicit adult content and violence.

It was very hard for me to get into the book but I kept going as it was gifted to me and I wanted to read it to the end to give an honest review. I do plan to go and get book one and then re-read this book after and see if my review changes.

It took me til about the middle of the book to get with the program. I love mythology and all but it was very confusing to me with Loki and some of the other references. Now Raven (a Valkyrie ) and Mangus (a Wolf Shifter or Einherjer) were one Hot couple when they were together and  of course that was not never enough at all in this book.  The biker gangs and all the names from both were so many they helped with the confusion as well but like I said all in all once I got into the book it was a 4 star read.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I really liked this product at first.  I made a few pizza pies with it and it does definitely crisp the crust very quickly.  So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."

Regardless of how you may feel about Iraq this book explains the day to day struggle that was the reality of this conflict and how it interacted with Afghanistan.  I was impressed with the involvement that President Obama had with getting Bin Laden.  I had always assumed that it just happened on his watch, but he was much more deeply involved than I thought.  I'll give him credit for that, but not much else.  The way Obama grinds though flag officers makes me wonder how much longer the military system will continue to produce the highly competent high level Generals and Admirals we must have to stay safe in a world that seems to hate us for who we are.  Thankfully there are people like Bob Gates who will lead and endure the realities of public life for the sake of our country."

We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked.  The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat.  It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run.  The timer goes up to 240 minutes.
The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working.  I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders.  I was wondering if it would work... it did.  It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running.  The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made.  The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable.  The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.  I can move it from place to place easily.
I use this item everyday.  It works well to dry the inside of wet or sweaty shoes.  I would recommend the dryer to anyone who wanted to preserve and protect their shoe investment.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The Wrong Side of Goodbye is the twenty first novel in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series.

I wondered where Connelly was going to take Harry once he left the LAPD. But once a cop, always a cop. Harry has joined the small San Fernando PD as a reserve officer. He's been working the case of The Screencutter, a serial rapist working in the area. Harry is also a private investigator now and is called to the home of a reclusive billionaire. At death's doorway, the man wants to know if he has any blood heirs. But there are those just as determined to see that none are found.

Connelly has come up with two great cases, both intriguing and well plotted. We meet a whole new set of characters in the new police department. I would definitely like to see more of this group and this setting. Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer) makes an appearance as well. I quite enjoy the two characters appearing in each other's cases.

This is the 21st entry, but this series has never lost it's momentum or freshness. Skillful storytelling, great characters, inventive plotting, excellent detective work and so entertaining.

The Wrong Side of Goodbye was a fantastic listen. Narrator Titus Welliver has become the voice of Bosch for me - gruff, growly, tough. His interpretation of the character absolutely matches my mental image. And he also stars in the television series Bosch."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A collection of stories inspired by the ""unsolved mysteries"" of ancient women. This book FASCINATED me. Ms. Guillaume took bits of history and asked ""what if?"" We don't often think of ancient women proposing a theeesome or sexually dominating a brand-new husband, but Guillaume leads readers to believe it's not only possible but likely to have happened.

My favorite stories were ""How the Lotus Blossoms"" (a possible origin for the barbaric foot-binding tradition in China, ""Buktu's Well"" (possible beginnings of the Timbuktu trading post in Mali), ""The Girl with the Golden Eye"" (a young woman with a prosthetic eye sees the future during orgasm), and ""Queen of Beauty"" (possible explanations for the mystery surrounding Nefertiti's unfinished bust and her disappearance after her husband's death). ""Queen of Beauty"" made me cry.

Some of the other stories were a little fetishy, challenging my ability to suspend disbelief, but there is enough excellent writing and variety to make this book well worth its five stars."

I haven't had to remove them yet, however they are stuck to tile so I'm not sure how the removable feature works but so far they have held up in the humidity of my bathroom very well. I would recommend these to my friends and family who might be looking for great hooks that hold up very well.

The kettle is very easy to set up and does not require a lot of effort. I am very pleased with the quality of the product. The machine works well.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I'm the type of person who, when I find a brand and style I like, I stick with them. My problem was my usual brand has been lacking in quality as of late. for the past 3 years, I was going through them very quickly. It was probably due to the frequent washings but I was having to replace them yearly.

So I decided to give Carhartt a try. I have recently switch to their jeans because of quality dropping in my usual brand and style so I decided to give these a try. They are strongly constructed and look good. Not as much room in the seat and thigh area as I would like but I'm getting used to it. Have been washed a few times and the color has not faded.

Some are saying that they feel rough and stiff. Well, yeah. Compared to my previous brand (which I will probably by for casual occasions and not need to was as frequently), these aren't very soft. But I was going for durable. While I work in an office, I do have to do some physical stuff. May I suggest using a liquid fabric softener. I always use it and have no problem with these pants.

Just remembered, I purchased these in blue with the same measurements. Even less room in the seat and thigh (meaning really tight you-know-where). Not sure what's up with that but I plan to get more in black and hopefully that was a fluke."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."

I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony A-100 on Amazon for $250. 00. It works perfectly and seems to last for quite a while. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade their old Sony A-100 to a better product. I have a Sony A-100 in my home that does not have a built in speaker that I use for sound. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a better product. I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this drive.  It's a solid drive, and it's solid.  It's a nice little drive.I bought this because it has the right size for my tablet and I like the color and the fact that it has a USB charging port. It's not for everyone, but for those who don't have an external charger, this is a good option.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.

I believe this is a book that should be required reading for anyone who is interested in the historical and political history of the Civil War.  The author provides a solid overview of the events of the war and explains the circumstances in which they occurred.  This is a great book for anyone interested in history and history of the Civil War.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and history of the Civil War.  Highly recommend.I enjoyed this book. I love her characters and her plot. I hope the series continues.I loved this book. I was just so excited to read it and read it again.  It was a wonderful story.  It is filled with mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery and mystery.  It is a wonderful book.  I would recommend this book.  You will enjoy it.  It is not a mystery book.  It is a story of a woman who finds her way back to her family.  She was raised in a small town, so she would never be able to go back home.  She tries to find her way back, but is unsuccessful.  She spends a lot of time in her home town and gets lost.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Searched for a hard surface vac for weeks to a better job on my hard surface floors, wood and porcelain tile...reading reviews on numerous vacs from $$ to $$$.  I actually got down to 2 Bissell, and decided to go with the bagless. Placed my order and it was here in a day it seemed.  What a great little vac....!!!!  Super power but with a button system conveniently located on the handle to reduce the suction to do my rag rugs and not suck them up...tools I most use, crevice and little brush right on handle...easy to dump, other filters easy to get at if needed.  Cord rewinds.. love the hard surface tool...little soft brushes that get the dirt but take care of my wood floors.  I notice I no longer have to go back over the floors with a dust mop to get the dust, this little sweeper gets it all.  Price is absolutely right and I was prepared to pay much more.  Very light weight but follows along with me fine...I have to move the cord a few times but no big deal, wand has plastic hook that sets it right on vac neatly for storage.  Think a really nice product that works well for what I want it to do."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book was great in revealing what it's like to be in a violent and abusive relationship and stuck. Eventually mother and son go into hiding in which I can just feel their pain in having to start over in a place where they have no friends or family; no support and live in fear. How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position. It boils down to being a no-win situation to some degree. While some people did not like the ending, I did. I thought it was realistic and really does capture what's there at the end of the road."

I am size 35"" bust/29.5"" waist/37.5"" hips and got the Large since it was a junior dress and I am a Misses (I am generally a medium in Misses) and it fit good in the hips and waist but a little loose in the bust/shoulder area- I am 5'6""/135lbs.  The dress length comes to exactly where is shows on the model in this listing.  The colors are vey nice and because it is a bandage dress- it give the body a nice ""hug"" showing off all your curves! --However, in the size large the dress is appropriate for work or office place as it was not too snug like a bandage dress usually is-it has a sophistication to it.  Dress is very comfortable and made well!  High quality!  I did end of exchanging the dress for a medium to get a more snug fit as I like a really contoured look.  The fit was great!  I LOVE it so much I am going to buy it in the other color (Mint) listed as well."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:
- Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power."

Lacey had a terrible time with the guys and decided to quit her job. She was just starting a new job and her friend, Danielle, is the head of the sports marketing company that she's been working on.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The first Pilots Hockey novel featured Aleksandr, a Russian Hockey player who claimed to need a translater, and Auden, an American who knows Russian because she was raised by her grandfather.

This is a cute story, but part of it didn't really mesh well for me.  Aleksandr first off didn't really need someone to translate.  I can get past that part but there's a lot of talk about all the guys who want to be with Auden throughout and it gets a little ridiculous.  Also, the breakup, which inevitably happens in romance novels, was over dramatic and for a ridiculous reason.  But all in all it was a good story and I did want to read the next one when I finished it."

Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I found this book to be a very enjoyable book to read and if helped fill in a few spaces left about the great names of the Civil War before they became Generals. I have always enjoy reading accounts of the war with  Mexico and seeing how the future enemies of the American Civil War fought  together, saved each others lives on occassions and learnt the common  lessons of war. This is a very interesting and well presented account  although I found the battle scenes lacking in depth but I would suppose  that was not the authors main focus but more on the people involved. I  think it may have helped to have added a few maps of the fighting in Mexico  and the Valley as if you have no prior knowledge of these areas you really  do not appreciate the efforts involved in moving from one point to another.  Overall this is a decent book and most people should enjoy immersing  themselves in this bit of history."

A must read for everyone -- extroverts and introverts. Also a great read for bosses. Cubicles are killing our workforce productivity, yet more and more office places are moving to them, in the belief they foster an ability to work together. This book stomps on that theory with aplomb."

The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night.

I have never read a book that has such a good ending.  I felt like I was right there with the main character.  I'm not going to say too much because the ending is too abrupt, but I feel like the author did a great job of giving the book a great ending.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!"

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I really think apple has missed the mark advertising the iPod touch mainly as a game machine. The apps are extraordinarily useful. I'm very glad I decided ( at the last minute ) to get the 32 gb model. I'm not using the iPod portion that much --some music and podcasts, but the add on apps have been very VERY useful. The screen is gorgeous , the keypad easy to use. If I had to quibble I'd say my biggest gripe is that flash and shockwave don't work yet. I know why apple has done that, but it's inconvenient. Youtube videos are fine. Battery life okay if you aren't on the internet the whole time -- i am, so it gets about five or six hours. Wifi reception has been excellent. Built in speaker is tinny and not loud enough, but i rarely use it so i didn't take off for that. There's an app to share files with your computer wirelessly, which is handy for transferring  stuff via webdav connection to read later when you have no connection. Another app lets you capture articles from news and web sources to revisit later. There's even an app to make voip calls from the touch.

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

But it did keep me flipping the pages to get to the climax.  Unfortunately the ending seemed a bit contrived and the non-New York characters were poorly developed.  I didn't notice so much with the characters from the medical examiner's office in New York because most of them have been in other Cook novels I've read.
Still and all the premise of the book was enough to keep me reading.  I was not totally comfortable with transgenic technology before I read the book, now I'm even less comfortable."

In my estimation it will take a very perceptive burglar to determine that it is not a real dog behind the door. In terms of construction quality relative to the price I would rate it on the cheap side and that is why I am taking off one star. I have it connected to power via a WeMo switch and it turns on when i leave home and off when I return. This works only if no batteries are installed.

This is the best Pete the Cat book, even better than ""I Love My White Shoes. "" Why? Because of this line: ""Did Pete cry? Goodness, no! Buttons come, and buttons go.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Got this 4 days ago, so far so good. I bought this for my husband who has developed allergies in the last year. We have two long haired cats and a 85 pound Lab. His allergies were so bad last week he woke up short of breath and couldn't sleep. I let this run on high for 6 hours the first day, then switched it to medium the first night. I turn it off when we wake up and switch it on an hour or two before bedtime. My husband has been able to sleep through the night and wakes up rested. He is also much less congested so his snoring has reduced which was a huge bonus for me. The meduim setting may take getting use to for some. I have a white noise sleep machine (to block out the snoring) and it is a little louder than that. It doesnt bother us but we are use to it. The quiet setting is even quieter than my sleep machine. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that suffers from pet allergies and doesnt want to have to shave or give up thier beloved pets.

I have golfed all over North America and have not yet found a course I couldn't download. The accuracy of the distances to hazards, front, midle and backs of greens is outstanding.  I am completly convinced this unti has lowered my scores by 2 or 3 strokes a round and has speeded up my rounds by at least 15 minutes. I regularly update both software and courses with no problems. The only downside I have found is that rechargeable AA bateries don't seem to last more than 1 1/2 rounds. Non rechargeable batteries seem to last two+ rounds."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands."

I've now had a few hours with this hub, which is about as good as it gets. I've found that it is really easy to set up and configure. It takes about 10 minutes to set up and it does a good job.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,This was my first time reading this author and I was not disappointed. She had great dialogue and chemistry between Jaro and Roslyn and managed to create a delightfully eccentric world for them to get to know one another in. There were plenty moments where I laughed out loud and while the suspense elements of Jaro's witness protection program were slightly unbelievable it definitely did not detract from the story. My one personal request would be for a little more steamy scenes between Jaro and Roslyn but the book definitely didn't feel like it was missing anything. I would for sure reccommend this book and you really can't beat the price.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book was like a breath of fresh air after decades of being immersed in the increasingly bizarre Niagara of conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination.  Posner did what no one thought possible, he drained a swamp.  Sticking to meticulous verifiable fact and going back to first sources Posner asserts that the truth was there all along.  His reading style is easy, moving along and building up the facts bit by bit.  What Posner shows is that these theories often collapse under the weight of their own Byzantine thinking.  I still reread it occasionally just to enjoy a careful mind making a logical case out of a morass of nonsense."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I did not expect much from this (having ordered from Patty Boutique before via eBay - it was hit or miss, and delivery always took forever). I only ordered because I'd get it within 2 days under Prime and could return it if anything went wrong.
The dress does not look like much when taken out of the plastic bag - the Navy Blue seems somewhat dull, and the fabric is soft cotton jersey, somewhat thin.
But boy, does it transform when put on! The pattern is really flattering and is really smart - though made in China, it is made for larger-boned European women and is very flattering. Here's what worked on my 5.4, 165-lb, slightly pregnant (and suddenly size 12 instead of 8) frame:
- Shoulders fit just right - nothing cuts into armpits, nothing falls off - sleeves start where they are supposed to start
- Sleeves themselves are of decent length - not too short, they run to mid-palm and can be pulled up slightly
- Neck line is beautiful - it drapes nicely on the chest, and would work for small or big-busted
- Length is great - hits right below the knee (and will probably hike up just a bit as belly grows)
- Ruched pattern in the front and in the back creates slim silhouette and has plenty of fabric to expand as pregnancy progresses
- Unless it fades or shrinks in laundry, I see myself wearing this dress when not pregnant - it would look nice on a curvy figure.

I think I will get it in a couple other colors, as it seems to be able to take me through summer and upcoming Fall.
If I accessorize right (tights or no tights, necklaces or shawls, shoes or boots) - it would work for the office and for going out."

I received this product at a promotional rate in return for giving only my honest opinion, and I would personally recommend this screen protector, most companies don't have this kind of quality, and Skinomi Does.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I loved the original Uncharted game when it came out.  It was a really cool game, had a good storyline, good graphics, was challenging enough to keep me interested, and the overall game play was pretty sweet.  My sister also loved it a lot.  She thought it was one of the best games she's ever played.  So when this one came out I decided to buy it for her.  She has been trying to get the platinum trophy for PSN ever since."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Just finished reading Primacy of Darkness (Brooklyn Shadows Book 3) by Brock Deskins. This was a wild ride from Book 1 throughout and ending with Book 3. I must say this was my favorite of the 3. The first 2 Books set us up for the climatic energy in Book 3. I really liked that all the characters from previous books play a continued part in the ending of this Trilogy. Incredibly imagined, yet believable character. Imagine if you will,  Jack the Ripper returning to modern times as a vampire in Brooklyn, New York! If you cannot make that leap let Brock make it for you and take this journey along with Leo, Kat, Marvin, Vincent, Trinh, Carol and a motley crew of vampires, werewolves, bloodlings and humans good and evil on this amazing adventure. I look forward to reading much more of Brocks work in the future.

Synopsis (from back cover): Jack the Ripper, sadistic madman of old London, once thought long dead, has returned to New York in an effort to quench his thirst for blood and mayhem. When the city's vampire enclave finds itself insufficient to deal with a madman of Jack's caliber, Vincent, the enclave head, enlists Leo Malone to put the maniac down before he reveals the existence of vampires as he throws the city into the throes of chaos and terror. Leo soon finds that Jack is not the only monster with which he must contend. A ghost from his past has also seemingly crawled from its grave and seeks to put an end to him and the rest of his kind."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Clearly written for and marketed to the audience of the Hunger Games books, this series looks to be not nearly as involving as Collins'. (And could the cover be any more an almost rip-off of the Hunger Games covers?)

The problem with Divergent is that the main character isn't nearly as easy to relate to as Katniss Everdeen. In fact, she's downright unlikeable for much of the book. And the setting, with the rigidly divided society, just doesn't really make sense.

This isn't a bad book, and I'm sure a lot of readers will find it enjoyable, but it wasn't for me. I won't be bothering with the rest of the series because I can't find it in myself to care what happens to these characters. Congrats to those who enjoy it, though."

I did get a free shipping label on the first one and the second one was great. The first one was defective and the second one is a good product. The second one is a little flimsy but I'm glad I got it for free. I just wish the first one had a more sturdy plastic part so I could try it out.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Dangerous Territory is an intriguing and exciting romance that takes you into the heart of the war in Afghanistan and into the heat of battle.  Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

Thrown together in the middle of Afghanistan, the chemistry between these two is undeniably electric, despite the circumstances they find themselves in.  Then, there is the fact that Josh ""hates"" reporters, which presents a different problem.  The danger, drama, and romance in Dangerous Territory will keep you on the edge of your seat, while you fan your face from the heat that isn't even coming from the desert.  I enjoyed this military romantic suspense story, which is something different that I usually don't read, and was a very welcome change that I enjoyed.

But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"sweet baby Jesus, I love this set and am very pleased with it.
